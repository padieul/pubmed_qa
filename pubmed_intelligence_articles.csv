37922461,Real-time liver motion estimation via deep learning-based angle-agnostic X-ray imaging.,37922461,"BACKGROUND: Real-time liver imaging is challenged by the short imaging time (within hundreds of milliseconds) to meet the temporal constraint posted by rapid patient breathing, resulting in extreme under-sampling for desired 3D imaging. Deep learning (DL)-based real-time imaging/motion estimation techniques are emerging as promising solutions, which can use a single X-ray projection to estimate 3D moving liver volumes by solved deformable motion. However, such techniques were mostly developed for a specific, fixed X-ray projection angle, thereby impractical to verify and guide arc-based radiotherapy with continuous gantry rotation.
PURPOSE: To enable deformable motion estimation and 3D liver imaging from individual X-ray projections acquired at arbitrary X-ray scan angles, and to further improve the accuracy of single X-ray-driven motion estimation.
METHODS: We developed a DL-based method, X360, to estimate the deformable motion of the liver boundary using an X-ray projection acquired at an arbitrary gantry angle (angle-agnostic). X360 incorporated patient-specific prior information from planning 4D-CTs to address the under-sampling issue, and adopted a deformation-driven approach to deform a prior liver surface mesh to new meshes that reflect real-time motion. The liver mesh motion is solved via motion-related image features encoded in the arbitrary-angle X-ray projection, and through a sequential combination of rigid and deformable registration modules. To achieve the angle agnosticism, a geometry-informed X-ray feature pooling layer was developed to allow X360 to extract angle-dependent image features for motion estimation. As a liver boundary motion solver, X360 was also combined with priorly-developed, DL-based optical surface imaging and biomechanical modeling techniques for intra-liver motion estimation and tumor localization.
RESULTS: With geometry-aware feature pooling, X360 can solve the liver boundary motion from an arbitrary-angle X-ray projection. Evaluated on a set of 10 liver patient cases, the mean (± s.d.) 95-percentile Hausdorff distance between the solved liver boundary and the ""ground-truth"" decreased from 10.9 (±4.5) mm (before motion estimation) to 5.5 (±1.9) mm (X360). When X360 was further integrated with surface imaging and biomechanical modeling for liver tumor localization, the mean (± s.d.) center-of-mass localization error of the liver tumors decreased from 9.4 (± 5.1) mm to 2.2 (± 1.7) mm.
CONCLUSION: X360 can achieve fast and robust liver boundary motion estimation from arbitrary-angle X-ray projections for real-time imaging guidance. Serving as a surface motion solver, X360 can be integrated into a combined framework to achieve accurate, real-time, and marker-less liver tumor localization.",37922461,"['Shao HC', 'Li Y', 'Wang J', 'Jiang S', 'Zhang Y']",37922461,2023,37922461,Med Phys

37922149,Validating the Generalizability of Ophthalmic Artificial Intelligence Models on Real-World Clinical Data.,37922149,"PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate generalizability of deep learning (DL) models trained on commonly used public fundus images to an instance of real-world data (RWD) for glaucoma diagnosis.
METHODS: We used Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary fundus data set as an instance of RWD in addition to six publicly available fundus data sets. We compared the performance of DL-trained models on public data and RWD for glaucoma classification and optic disc (OD) segmentation tasks. For each task, we created models trained on each data set, respectively, and each model was tested on both data sets. We further examined each model's decision-making process and learned embeddings for the glaucoma classification task.
RESULTS: Using public data for the test set, public-trained models outperformed RWD-trained models in OD segmentation and glaucoma classification with a mean intersection over union of 96.3% and mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 95.0%, respectively. Using the RWD test set, the performance of public models decreased by 8.0% and 18.4% to 85.6% and 76.6% for OD segmentation and glaucoma classification tasks, respectively. RWD models outperformed public models on RWD test sets by 2.0% and 9.5%, respectively, in OD segmentation and glaucoma classification tasks.
CONCLUSIONS: DL models trained on commonly used public data have limited ability to generalize to RWD for classifying glaucoma. They perform similarly to RWD models for OD segmentation.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: RWD is a potential solution for improving generalizability of DL models and enabling clinical translations in the care of prevalent blinding ophthalmic conditions, such as glaucoma.",37922149,"['Rashidisabet H', 'Sethi A', 'Jindarak P', 'Edmonds J', 'Chan RVP', 'Leiderman YI', 'Vajaranant TS', 'Yi D']",37922149,2023,37922149,Transl Vis Sci Technol
37922148,"Magnetically Responsive Superhydrophobic Surface with Reversibly Switchable Wettability: Fabrication, Deformation, and Switching Performance.",37922148,"Responsive surfaces with reversibly switchable wettability have attracted widespread attention due to their diverse range of potential applications in the past few years. As a representative example, the magnetically actuated dynamic regulation structured surfaces provide a convenient and unique approach to achieving remote control and instantaneous response. However, (quasi)quantitative design strategies and economical fabrication methods with high precision for magnetically responsive surfaces with both superhydrophobicity and superior wetting switchability still remain challenging. In this work, a manufacturing technique for high-aspect-ratio magnetically responsive superhydrophobic surfaces (MRSSs) via the integration of micromilling, replica molding, and coating modification is proposed. The geometrical parameters of magnetic micropillar arrays (MMAs) on the surface are specially designed on the basis of the Cassie-Wenzel (C-W) transition critical condition in order to guarantee the initial superhydrophobicity of the surface. Benefiting from the reconfigurable microstructures of MMAs in response to magnetic fields (i.e., shifting between upright and curved states), the wettability and adhesion of MRSSs can be reversibly switched. The smart wetting controllability presented on MRSSs is proven to be largely determined by the geometrical parameters and deformation capacity of the micropillars, while the visible wetting switching is mainly ascribed to the variation in wetting regimes of droplets. The modification of the superhydrophobic coatings on the micropillar top is also demonstrated to be capable of further enhancing the initial hydrophobicity and switchable wettability of surfaces, producing water droplets with a volume of 4-6 μL to exhibit the reversible switch from low adhesive superhydrophobicity to high adhesive hydrophilicity. In addition to providing an alternative fabrication strategy, this work also presents a set of design concepts for more applicable and sensitive MRSSs, offering a reference to both fundamental research and practical applications.",37922148,"['Sun R', 'Wu C', 'Hou B', 'Li X', 'Wu J', 'Liu C', 'Chen M']",37922148,2023,37922148,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces

37921927,Prediction of hospitalization and waiting time within 24 hours of emergency department patients with unstructured text data.,37921927,"Overcrowding of emergency departments is a global concern, leading to numerous negative consequences. This study aimed to develop a useful and inexpensive tool derived from electronic medical records that supports clinical decision-making and can be easily utilized by emergency department physicians. We presented machine learning models that predicted the likelihood of hospitalizations within 24 hours and estimated waiting times. Moreover, we revealed the enhanced performance of these machine learning models compared to existing models by incorporating unstructured text data. Among several evaluated models, the extreme gradient boosting model that incorporated text data yielded the best performance. This model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of 0.922 and an area under the precision-recall curve score of 0.687. The mean absolute error revealed a difference of approximately 3 hours. Using this model, we classified the probability of patients not being admitted within 24 hours as Low, Medium, or High and identified important variables influencing this classification through explainable artificial intelligence.

37921836,"Mpox Knowledge, Attitudes, & Practices Among Persons Presenting for JYNNEOS Vaccination - District of Columbia, August-October 2022.",37921836,"BACKGROUND: More than 30,000 mpox cases have been confirmed in the United States since May 2022. Mpox cases have disproportionally occurred among adult gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender persons, and Black and Hispanic/Latino persons. We examined knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding mpox vaccination among adults presenting for vaccination to inform prevention efforts.
METHODS: We collected mixed-methods data from a convenience sample of adults presenting for JYNNEOS vaccination at three DC Health mpox vaccine clinics during August-October 2022. Survey and interview topics included knowledge about mpox symptoms and vaccine protection, beliefs about vaccine access, and trusted sources of information.
RESULTS: In total, 352 participants completed self-administered surveys and 62 participants completed an in-depth interview (IDI). Three main themes emerged from survey and interview data. First, most participants had a general understanding about mpox, but gaps remained in comprehensive understanding about mpox symptoms, modes of transmission, vaccine protection, personal risk, and vaccine dosing strategies. Second, participants had high trust in public health agencies. Third, participants wanted more equitable and less stigmatizing access to mpox vaccine services.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-stigmatizing, inclusive, and clear communication from trusted sources, including public health agencies, is needed to address mpox knowledge gaps and increase vaccine access and uptake in affected communities.

37921807,The bad and the good of trends in model building and refinement for sparse-data regions: pernicious forms of overfitting versus good new tools and predictions.,37921807,"Model building and refinement, and the validation of their correctness, are very effective and reliable at local resolutions better than about 2.5 Å for both crystallography and cryo-EM. However, at local resolutions worse than 2.5 Å both the procedures and their validation break down and do not ensure reliably correct models. This is because in the broad density at lower resolution, critical features such as protein backbone carbonyl O atoms are not just less accurate but are not seen at all, and so peptide orientations are frequently wrongly fitted by 90-180°. This puts both backbone and side chains into the wrong local energy minimum, and they are then worsened rather than improved by further refinement into a valid but incorrect rotamer or Ramachandran region. On the positive side, new tools are being developed to locate this type of pernicious error in PDB depositions, such as CaBLAM, EMRinger, Pperp diagnosis of ribose puckers, and peptide flips in PDB-REDO, while interactive modeling in Coot or ISOLDE can help to fix many of them. Another positive trend is that artificial intelligence predictions such as those made by AlphaFold2 contribute additional evidence from large multiple sequence alignments, and in high-confidence parts they provide quite good starting models for loops, termini or whole domains with otherwise ambiguous density.",37921807,"['Richardson JS', 'Williams CJ', 'Chen VB', 'Prisant MG', 'Richardson DC']",37921807,2023,37921807,Acta Crystallogr D Struct Biol

Particularly, it would trigger either continuous or discontinuous variation of the bulk orientation, i.e., a phenomenon known as the anchoring or orientational transition. Despite its prime importance in developing novel optoelectronic devices, how the surface anchoring patterns dedicate the energy landscape of a system, thus the equilibrium state, still needs to be understood. Here, we designed a simulation to model boundary substrates with two randomly mixed anchoring domains in space, which exhibit planar and homeotropic preferences. We numerically obtain general bulk orientational state diagrams under various surface and electric field conditions, which reveal the roles of each domain's size and surface fraction and anchoring strength on the bulk orientational state. Furthermore, we examine how the external electric field modifies the orientational state diagram and uncovers a field-assisted anchoring transition.

37921434,Cohort profile update: The Canadian Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals Child Development study (MIREC-CD PLUS).,37921434,"BACKGROUND: The pan-Canadian Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study was established to determine whether maternal environmental chemical exposures were associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes in 2001 pregnant women.
OBJECTIVES: The MIREC-Child Development (CD PLUS) study followed this cohort with the goal of assessing the potential effects of prenatal exposures on anthropometry and neurodevelopment in early childhood.
POPULATION: MIREC families with children between the ages of 15 months and 5 years who had agreed to be contacted for future research (n = 1459) were invited to participate in MIREC-CD PLUS which combines data collected from an online Maternal Self-Administered Questionnaire with biomonitoring and neurodevelopment data collected from two in-person visits.
PRELIMINARY RESULTS: Between April 2013 and March 2015, 803 children participated in the Biomonitoring visit where we collected anthropometric measures, blood, and urine from the children. The Behavioural Assessment System for Children-2, Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function, MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories and the Communication subscale of the Adaptive Behaviour Scale from the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III are available on close to 900 children. There were 610 singleton children who completed in-person visits for neurodevelopment assessments including the Social Responsiveness Scale, Wechsler Preschool Primary Scale of Intelligence-III and NEuroPSYchological assessments (NEPSY). Currently, we are following the cohort into early adolescence to measure the impact of early life exposures on endocrine and metabolic function (MIREC-ENDO).
CONCLUSIONS: Data collection for the MIREC-CD PLUS study is complete and analysis of the data continues. We are now extending the follow-up of the cohort into adolescence to measure the impact of early life exposures on endocrine and metabolic function (MIREC-ENDO). MIREC-CD PLUS is limited by loss to follow-up and the fact that mothers are predominately of higher socioeconomic status and 'White' ethnicity, which limits our generalizability.

37921358,Climate warming could free cold-adapted trees from C-conservative allocation strategy of storage over growth.,37921358,"Carbon allocation has been fundamental for long-lived trees to survive cold stress at their upper elevation range limit. Although carbon allocation between non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) storage and structural growth is well-documented, it still remains unclear how ongoing climate warming influences these processes, particularly whether these two processes will shift in parallel or respond divergently to warming. Using a combination of an in situ downward-transplant warming experiment and an ex situ chamber warming treatment, we investigated how subalpine fir trees at their upper elevation limit coordinated carbon allocation priority among different sinks (e.g., NSC storage and structural growth) at whole-tree level in response to elevated temperature. We found that transplanted individuals from the upper elevation limit to lower elevations generally induced an increase in specific leaf area, but there was no detected evidence of warming effect on leaf-level saturated photosynthetic rates. Additionally, our results challenged the expectation that climate warming will accelerate structural carbon accumulation while maintaining NSC constant. Instead, individuals favored allocating available carbon to NSC storage over structural growth after 1 year of warming, despite the amplification in total biomass encouraged by both in situ and ex situ experimental warming. Unexpectedly, continued warming drove a regime shift in carbon allocation priority, which was manifested in the increase of NSC storage in synchrony to structural growth enhancement. These findings imply that climate warming would release trees at their cold edge from C-conservative allocation strategy of storage over structural growth. Thus, understanding the strategical regulation of the carbon allocation priority and the distinctive function of carbon sink components is of great implication for predicting tree fate in the future climate warming.",37921358,"['Zhou Q', 'Shi H', 'He R', 'Liu H', 'Zhu W', 'Wu S', 'Zhang Q', 'Dang H']",37921358,2023,37921358,Glob Chang Biol

We used the Shroomery.org website to retrieve 7317 publicly available retrospective psychedelic experience reports of psychedelic use, primarily of psilocybin, and have a designated experience intensity level self-assessed by the text authors during submission of the report. We counted the mystical language words using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software and additionally performed sentiment analysis of all reports. We found that the occurrence of mystical language grew with increased self-reported experience intensity. We also found that negative sentiment increased, and positive sentiment decreased as self-reported psychedelic experience intensity increased. These two findings raise the question of whether mystical experiences can co-exist with challenging elements within the psychedelic experience, a consideration for future qualitative studies. We present a new mystical language dictionary measure for further use and expansion, with some suggestions on how it can be used in future studies.",37921118,"['Žuljević MF', 'Mijatović A', 'Marušić SL', 'Kudrjavets G', 'Buljan I', 'Hren D']",37921118,2023,37921118,J Psychoactive Drugs
37921030,Why do errors arise in artificial intelligence diagnostic tools in histopathology and how can we minimize them?,37921030,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic tools can offer numerous benefits to the field of histopathology, including improved diagnostic accuracy, efficiency and productivity. As a result, such tools are likely to have an increasing role in routine practice. However, all AI tools are prone to errors, and these AI-associated errors have been identified as a major risk in the introduction of AI into healthcare. The errors made by AI tools are different, in terms of both cause and nature, to the errors made by human pathologists. As highlighted by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, it is imperative that practising pathologists understand the potential limitations of AI tools, including the errors made. Pathologists are in a unique position to be gatekeepers of AI tool use, maximizing patient benefit while minimizing harm. Furthermore, their pathological knowledge is essential to understanding when, and why, errors have occurred and so to developing safer future algorithms. This paper summarises the literature on errors made by AI diagnostic tools in histopathology. These include erroneous errors, data concerns (data bias, hidden stratification, data imbalances, distributional shift, and lack of generalisability), reinforcement of outdated practices, unsafe failure mode, automation bias, and insensitivity to impact. Methods to reduce errors in both tool design and clinical use are discussed, and the practical roles for pathologists in error minimisation are highlighted. This aims to inform and empower pathologists to move safely through this seismic change in practice and help ensure that novel AI tools are adopted safely.",37921030,"['Evans H', 'Snead D']",37921030,2023,37921030,Histopathology
37921018,Early prognostication of critical patients with spinal cord injury: A machine learning study with 1485 cases.,37921018,"STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case-series.
OBJECTIVE: The study aims to use machine-learning (ML) to predict the discharge destination of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Prognostication following SCI is vital, especially for critical patients who need intensive care.
METHODS: Clinical data of patients diagnosed with SCI were extracted from a publicly available ICU database. The firstly recorded data of the included patients were used to develop a total of 98 ML classifiers, seeking to predict discharge destination (e.g. death, further medical care, home). The micro-average area under the curve (AUC) was the main indicator to assess discrimination. The best average-AUC classifier and the best death-sensitivity classifier were integrated into an ensemble classifier. The discrimination of the ensemble classifier was compared with top death-sensitivity classifiers and top average-AUC classifiers. Additionally, prediction consistency and clinical utility were also assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 1485 SCI patients were included. The ensemble classifier had a micro-average AUC of 0.851, which was only slightly inferior to the best average-AUC classifier (P=0.10) The best average-AUC classifier death sensitivity was much lower than that of the ensemble classifier. The ensemble classifier had a death sensitivity of 0.452, which was inferior to top 8 death-sensitivity classifiers, whose micro-average AUC were inferior to the ensemble classifier (P<0.05). Additionally, the ensemble classifier demonstrated a comparable Brier score and superior Net benefit in the decision curve analysis, when compared to the performance of the origin classifiers.
CONCLUSIONS: The ensemble classifier shows an overall superior performance in predicting discharge destination considering discrimination ability, prediction consistency and clinical utility. This classifier system may aid in the clinical management of critical SCI patients in the early phase following injury.

37921010,Plant disease identification using contextual mask auto-encoder optimized with dynamic differential annealed optimization algorithm.,37921010,"Most of the food consumed worldwide is produced by plants. Plant disease is a major cause of reduced production, but can be managed with regular monitoring. Manually observing plant diseases takes more time and is error-prone. Early detection of plant diseases with the aid of artificial intelligence and computer vision can decrease the effects of disease and help plants withstand the downsides of continuing surveillance. In this manuscript, plant disease identification using contextual mask auto-encoder optimized with dynamic differential annealed optimization algorithm (PDI-CMAE-DDAOA) is proposed. The plant village dataset is used to collect the images. Then the image is fed to preprocessing. Using an adaptive self-guided filter approach, the noise is removed from the input images during the pre-processing phase. The result of the pre-processing section serves as input for the feature extraction segment. Four statistical features, including mean, variance, entropy, and kurtosis, are recovered from the cosine similarity hidden Markov model (CSHMM). The contextual mask auto-encoder (CMAE) is given the extracted features to accurately classify the healthy and unhealthy regions of the plant image. The issue of slow convergence affects the CMAE. However, it is noted that the CMAE converges more quickly with deep learning features than with texture features in this instance. The CMAE classifier generally does not exhibit any adaptation of optimization algorithms for determining the best parameters to ensure the precise classification of plant disease. Therefore, dynamic differential annealed optimization algorithm (DDAOA) is considered to enhance the CMAE classifier, which accurately distinguishes between healthy and diseased plants. The proposed PDI-CMAE-DDAOA is done in Python. The efficacy of PDI-CMAE-DDAOA is evaluated under some performance metrics, like accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, specificity, error rate, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), computational time. The proposed method provides higher accuracy 23.34%, 34.33%, and 32.07%; higher sensitivity 36.67%, 36.33%, and 23.21%; higher F1-score 46.67%, 57.56%, and 43.21%; higher specificity 56.67%, 67.56%, and 23.21% analyzed with existing models, like transfer learning-based deep ensemble neural network for plant leaf infection recognition (PDI-DENN), plant disease detection with hybrid model based on convolutional auto-encoder and convolutional neural network (PDI-CAE-CNN), and automatic and reliable leaf disease finding depending on deep learning methods (PDI-EN-CNN), respectively. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS: To find the plant disease at early stage. To present PDI-CMAE-DDAOA. To get better classification accuracy by extracting the optimal features with the help of efficient CSHMM. To minimize the error during classification process. To maximize high area under curve value.",37921010,"['Prasannakumar M', 'Latha K']",37921010,2023,37921010,Microsc Res Tech
37920994,Multi-objective optimization of cortical bone grinding parameters based on particle swarm optimization.,37920994,"Grinding is a fundamental operation in craniotomy. Suitable grinding parameters will not only reduce force damage, but also ensure grinding efficiency. In this study, the regression equations of material removal rate and grinding force were obtained based on the theory of cortical bone grinding and full factorial test results, a multi-objective optimization based on the particle swarm algorithm was proposed for optimizing the grinding parameters: spindle speed, feed speed, and grinding depth in the grinding process. Two conflicting objectives, minimum grinding force and maximum material removal rate, were optimized simultaneously. The results revealed that the optimal grinding parameter combination and optimization results were as follows: spindle speed of 5000 rpm, feed rate of 60 mm/min, grinding depth of 0.6 mm, grinding force of 15.1 N, and material removal rate of 113.8 mm",37920994,"['Zheng Q', 'Zhu Y', 'Fan Z', 'Wang D', 'Zhang C', 'Liu S', 'Hu Y', 'Fu W']",37920994,2023,37920994,Proc Inst Mech Eng H
