23277023,"The cochlear outer hair cells serve a tuning function, and any dysfunction of their electromotile response can be reflected in language disorders. Otoacoustic emissions can be used to determine any dysfunction of these cells. A set of clinical records was established to register the neurological and auditory functioning in 42 children, followed by assessment with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), the Initial Language Test (ILT), the Auditory and Phonetic Discrimination Evaluation (APDE), tests for measuring Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP) and Transient Otoacoustic Emissions (TOAE). Subjects were classified into 3 groups in this study: Control (C; n = 20), Syntactic Phonological Disorder (SPD; n = 17), and those with Phonological Disability (PD; n = 5). BAEP studies showed a clear response when all children were stimulated to 20 dB. TOAE responses displayed clear and significant differences with half-octave band reproducibility for both ears, the largest effect being observed in the right ear. The results that were compared using ANOVA tests, showed that cochlear processing affects the brain language function, playing a critical role in the language phonetic process.",Is dysfunction of the cochlear outer hair cells reflected in language disorders?,Yes,What assessment tools were used in the study to evaluate neurological and auditory functioning in children?," The study used the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), the Initial Language Test (ILT), the Auditory and Phonetic Discrimination Evaluation (APDE), tests for measuring Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP), and Transient Otoacoustic Emissions (TOAE).",Which groups were subjects classified into in this study?,"Subjects were classified into three groups: Control (C; n = 20), Syntactic Phonological Disorder (SPD; n = 17), and those with Phonological Disability (PD; n = 5).",How did BAEP studies show responses in the study when children were stimulated to 20 dB?,BAEP studies showed a clear response when all children were stimulated to 20 dB.,What would be the potential impact if there is dysfunction in the cochlear outer hair cells' electromotile response?,The abstract does not provide information on the potential impact of dysfunction in the cochlear outer hair cells' electromotile response.,"What role does cochlear processing play in the language phonetic process, according to the study?","Cochlear processing was found to affect the brain language function, playing a critical role in the language phonetic process, as suggested by the study results."
23356683,"Development of the Woodcock-Johnson (3rd ed.; WJ-III; Woodcock, McGrew & Mather, 2001a) was guided in part by Carroll's (1993) 3-stratum theory of cognitive abilities and based on confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), even though Carroll used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to derive his theory. Using CFA, McGrew and Woodcock (2001) found a 9-factor model across all age ranges. To determine if the 9-factor structure holds for the full WJ-III battery, we applied currently recognized best practices in EFA to 2 school-aged 42-subtest correlation matrices (ages 9-13 and 14-19 years). Six factors emerged at the 9-13 age range, while 5 factors were indicated at the 14-19 age range. The resulting 1st-order factors displayed patterns of both convergence with and divergence from the WJ-III results presented in the Technical Manual. These results also revealed a robust manifestation of general intelligence (g) that dwarfed the variance attributed to the lower order factors. It is surprising that this study represents the first time the WJ-III full battery was subjected to EFA analyses given the instrument's significant use by practitioners and that it served as the initial evidentiary basis for Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory. The lack of confirmation of CFA results with EFA methods in the current study permits questioning of the structure of the WJ-III and its relationship with CHC theory. Additional independent, structural analyses are clearly indicated for the WJ-III full test battery before we can be confident in its structure.",Was the development of the Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-III) influenced by Carroll's 3-stratum theory?,Yes,What was the result of applying confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to the Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-III)?, A 9-factor model was found across all age ranges.,List the number of factors that emerged in the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) for the 9-13 age range and the 14-19 age range.,"6 factors for 9-13 age range, 5 factors for 14-19 age range.",Why is there a need for additional independent structural analyses of the WJ-III full test battery?,"Due to the lack of confirmation of CFA results with EFA methods, raising questions about the structure of WJ-III and its relationship with Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory.",What would happen if the structure of the Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-III) remains unconfirmed through additional analyses?,Continued uncertainty about the WJ-III's structure and its alignment with CHC theory.,"What factors contributed to the surprising nature of the study, being the first time the WJ-III full battery was subjected to EFA analyses?","The study's surprising nature arises from the significant use of WJ-III by practitioners and its role as the initial evidentiary basis for Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory, prompting questions about its structure and relationship with CHC theory."
23490758,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits have been recognized as a key feature of schizophrenia, since the first description by Kraepelin. Specifically, lower intelligence is considered a core feature of the disorder and may represent a risk factor for its development. However, whether global intelligence decreases over time in schizophrenia is not known. The aims of this quantitative meta-analysis are to gather, integrate and estimate the overall mean effect size of IQ change over time in schizophrenia as compared to healthy individuals. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Longitudinal studies with at least two intelligence assessments in schizophrenia cohorts were retrieved. Studies had to report sufficient data on IQ-change and include data from healthy comparisons for computation of effect sizes. For each study, the Cohen d was calculated as well as a combined mean effect size. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified. Eight studies with a total of 280 patients and 306 healthy controls were suitable to be included. The mean weighted baseline IQ was 97.20 for patients and 109.26 for controls. The mean weighted IQ-change per year was +0.33 for patients and +2.08 for controls. The combined effect size was Cohen's d = -0.48, p = 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: A global cognitive deficit is present in patients with schizophrenia expressed as a lower test score increase over repeated testing as compared to healthy subjects possibly due to the lack of practice effects in patients. Thus, schizophrenia is characterized by a relative lack of gain in global cognitive abilities over time.",Is lower intelligence considered a core feature of schizophrenia?,Yes,How many studies were included in the meta-analysis?,Fourteen studies were identified.,What were the mean weighted baseline IQ scores for patients and controls?,"Patients: 97.20, Controls: 109.26.",Why is a global cognitive deficit present in patients with schizophrenia according to the study?,"The deficit is expressed as a lower test score increase over repeated testing, possibly due to the lack of practice effects in patients.",What would happen if schizophrenia were not characterized by a relative lack of gain in global cognitive abilities over time?,The study does not provide information on hypothetical scenarios.,What are the potential implications of the observed global cognitive deficit in patients with schizophrenia?,"The study does not explicitly discuss the implications, requiring additional information and interpretation beyond the provided abstract."
20301331,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature. Affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal bossing and midface retrusion. In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed. Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in infancy. Additional complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals. In individuals in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty or who have atypical findings, identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FGFR3 can establish the diagnosis. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Vosoritide, a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog, was recently approved to enhance height in individuals with achondroplasia from age five years until growth plates close. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be required for increased intracranial pressure; suboccipital decompression as indicated for signs and symptoms of craniocervical junction compression; adenotonsillectomy, positive airway pressure, and, rarely, tracheostomy to correct obstructive sleep apnea; pressure-equalizing tubes for middle ear dysfunction; monitor and treat obesity; evaluation and treatment by an orthopedist if progressive bowing of the legs arises; spinal surgery may be needed for severe, persistent kyphosis; surgery to correct spinal stenosis in symptomatic adults; modification in the school and work setting to optimize function; educational support in socialization and school adjustment. Surveillance: Monitor height, weight, and head circumference in childhood using growth curves standardized for achondroplasia; evaluation of developmental milestones throughout infancy and childhood using achondroplasia-specific standards; baseline neuroimaging of craniocervical junction and brain in infancy; neurologic examinations monitoring for signs of cervical myelopathy; monitor for signs and symptoms of sleep apnea; hearing evaluation as a newborn and tympanometric and behavioral audiometric evaluation by age approximately one year; monitor for middle ear problems or evidence of hearing loss in childhood; clinical assessment for kyphosis and bowed legs, with radiographic evaluation and referral to an orthopedist if necessary; in adults, clinical history and neurologic examination to screen for spinal stenosis with development of any new signs or symptoms or at least every three to five years; discuss social adjustment at each visit with primary care provider. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Rear-facing car seats should be used as long as possible to avoid injury from motor vehicle accident. Avoid soft-back infant seats and front carriers without a firm back. Avoid activities in which there is risk of injury to the craniocervical junction, such as collision sports; use of a trampoline; diving from diving boards; vaulting in gymnastics; and hanging upside down from the knees or feet on playground equipment (due to risk of falling onto the head or neck). Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with achondroplasia must undergo cesarean section delivery because of small pelvic size. GENETIC COUNSELING: Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Around 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Such parents have a very low risk of having another child with achondroplasia. An individual with achondroplasia who has a reproductive partner with average stature is at 50% risk in each pregnancy of having a child with achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk to their offspring of having average stature is 25%; of having achondroplasia, 50%; and of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal condition), 25%. If the proband and the proband's reproductive partner are affected with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of inheriting two dominant skeletal dysplasias. If the FGFR3 pathogenic variant has been identified in the affected parent or parents, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for achondroplasia is possible.",Is achondroplasia inherited in an autosomal dominant manner?,Yes,What are some clinical characteristics of individuals affected by achondroplasia?,"Clinical characteristics include rhizomelic shortening of limbs, macrocephaly, frontal bossing, midface retrusion, and hypotonia in infancy.",What are some complications associated with achondroplasia?,"Complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, spinal stenosis, and increased risk of death in infancy due to craniocervical junction compression.",Why do pregnant women with achondroplasia undergo cesarean section delivery?,Due to the small pelvic size associated with achondroplasia.,"What would happen if activities with a risk of craniocervical junction injury, such as hanging upside down, are avoided?",The risk of injury to the craniocervical junction is reduced.,What factors contribute to the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt in individuals with achondroplasia?,"The need for ventriculoperitoneal shunt may arise from increased intracranial pressure, a complication of achondroplasia, which can be monitored through clinical assessments and neuroimaging."
