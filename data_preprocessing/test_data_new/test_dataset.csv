20301331	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature. Affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal bossing and midface retrusion. In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed. Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in infancy. Additional complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals. In individuals in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty or who have atypical findings, identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FGFR3 can establish the diagnosis. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Vosoritide, a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog, was recently approved to enhance height in individuals with achondroplasia from age five years until growth plates close. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be required for increased intracranial pressure; suboccipital decompression as indicated for signs and symptoms of craniocervical junction compression; adenotonsillectomy, positive airway pressure, and, rarely, tracheostomy to correct obstructive sleep apnea; pressure-equalizing tubes for middle ear dysfunction; monitor and treat obesity; evaluation and treatment by an orthopedist if progressive bowing of the legs arises; spinal surgery may be needed for severe, persistent kyphosis; surgery to correct spinal stenosis in symptomatic adults; modification in the school and work setting to optimize function; educational support in socialization and school adjustment. Surveillance: Monitor height, weight, and head circumference in childhood using growth curves standardized for achondroplasia; evaluation of developmental milestones throughout infancy and childhood using achondroplasia-specific standards; baseline neuroimaging of craniocervical junction and brain in infancy; neurologic examinations monitoring for signs of cervical myelopathy; monitor for signs and symptoms of sleep apnea; hearing evaluation as a newborn and tympanometric and behavioral audiometric evaluation by age approximately one year; monitor for middle ear problems or evidence of hearing loss in childhood; clinical assessment for kyphosis and bowed legs, with radiographic evaluation and referral to an orthopedist if necessary; in adults, clinical history and neurologic examination to screen for spinal stenosis with development of any new signs or symptoms or at least every three to five years; discuss social adjustment at each visit with primary care provider. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Rear-facing car seats should be used as long as possible to avoid injury from motor vehicle accident. Avoid soft-back infant seats and front carriers without a firm back. Avoid activities in which there is risk of injury to the craniocervical junction, such as collision sports; use of a trampoline; diving from diving boards; vaulting in gymnastics; and hanging upside down from the knees or feet on playground equipment (due to risk of falling onto the head or neck). Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with achondroplasia must undergo cesarean section delivery because of small pelvic size. GENETIC COUNSELING: Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Around 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Such parents have a very low risk of having another child with achondroplasia. An individual with achondroplasia who has a reproductive partner with average stature is at 50% risk in each pregnancy of having a child with achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk to their offspring of having average stature is 25%; of having achondroplasia, 50%; and of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal condition), 25%. If the proband and the proband's reproductive partner are affected with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of inheriting two dominant skeletal dysplasias. If the FGFR3 pathogenic variant has been identified in the affected parent or parents, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for achondroplasia is possible.

Hypothetical	What would happen if a child with achondroplasia does not receive appropriate treatment and surveillance?

20301451	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; also known as Hunter syndrome) is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The vast majority of affected individuals are male; on rare occasion heterozygous females manifest findings. Age of onset, disease severity, and rate of progression vary significantly among affected males. In those with early progressive disease, CNS involvement (manifest primarily by progressive cognitive deterioration), progressive airway disease, and cardiac disease usually result in death in the first or second decade of life. In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal tunnel syndrome. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MPS II is established in a male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme activity in white cells, fibroblasts, or plasma in the presence of normal activity of at least one other sulfatase. Detection of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in IDS confirms the diagnosis in a male proband with an unusual phenotype or a phenotype that does not match the results of GAG testing. The diagnosis of MPS II is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical features by identification of a heterozygous IDS pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Interventions commonly include: developmental, occupational, and physical therapy; shunting for hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy; positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or tracheostomy); carpal tunnel release; cardiac valve replacement; inguinal hernia repair; hip replacement. Prevention of primary manifestations: Weekly enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with infusions of idursulfase (Elaprase((R))), a recombinant form of human iduronate 2-sulfatase, is approved to treat somatic manifestations and prolong survival. Pretreatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or antihistamines may be needed for mild or moderate infusion reactions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (using umbilical cord blood or bone marrow) could provide sufficient enzyme activity to slow or stop the progression of the disease; however, no controlled clinical studies have been conducted in MPS II. Prevention of secondary complications: Anesthesia is best administered in centers familiar with the potential complications in persons with MPS II. Surveillance: Depends on organ system and disease severity and usually includes annual: cardiology evaluation and echocardiogram; pulmonary evaluation including pulmonary function testing; audiogram; ophthalmology examination; developmental assessment; neurologic examination. Additional studies may include: sleep study for obstructive apnea; nerve conduction velocity to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome; head/neck MRI to document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing; opening pressure on lumbar puncture; and orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease. Evaluation of relatives at risk: While clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression, it is unclear at present whether the potential benefits of early initiation of ERT justify early diagnosis by either newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives. GENETIC COUNSELING: MPS II is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has the pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers. Germline mosaicism has been observed. Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.

MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Interventions commonly include: developmental, occupational, and physical therapy; shunting for hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy; positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or tracheostomy); carpal tunnel release; cardiac valve replacement; inguinal hernia repair; hip replacement. Prevention of primary manifestations: Weekly enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with infusions of idursulfase (Elaprase((R))), a recombinant form of human iduronate 2-sulfatase, is approved to treat somatic manifestations and prolong survival. Pretreatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or antihistamines may be needed for mild or moderate infusion reactions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (using umbilical cord blood or bone marrow) could provide sufficient enzyme activity to slow or stop the progression of the disease; however, no controlled clinical studies have been conducted in MPS II. Prevention of secondary complications: Anesthesia is best administered in centers familiar with the potential complications in persons with MPS II. Surveillance: Depends on organ system and disease severity and usually includes annual: cardiology evaluation and echocardiogram; pulmonary evaluation including pulmonary function testing; audiogram; ophthalmology examination; developmental assessment; neurologic examination. Additional studies may include: sleep study for obstructive apnea; nerve conduction velocity to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome; head/neck MRI to document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing; opening pressure on lumbar puncture; and orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease. Evaluation of relatives at risk: While clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression, it is unclear at present whether the potential benefits of early initiation of ERT justify early diagnosis by either newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives. GENETIC COUNSELING: MPS II is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has the pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers. Germline mosaicism has been observed. Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.	Causal	How is the diagnosis of MPS II established in a male proband?	The diagnosis of MPS II is established in a male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme activity in white cells, fibroblasts, or plasma in the presence of normal activity of at least one other sulfatase.
20301451	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; also known as Hunter syndrome) is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The vast majority of affected individuals are male; on rare occasion heterozygous females manifest findings. Age of onset, disease severity, and rate of progression vary significantly among affected males. In those with early progressive disease, CNS involvement (manifest primarily by progressive cognitive deterioration), progressive airway disease, and cardiac disease usually result in death in the first or second decade of life. In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal tunnel syndrome. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of MPS II is established in a male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme activity in white cells, fibroblasts, or plasma in the presence of normal activity of at least one other sulfatase.

Hypothetical	What would happen if there was a significant breakthrough in the treatment of MPS II, allowing for a potential cure or disease-modifying therapy?	The potential cure or disease-modifying therapy could significantly improve the prognosis and quality of life for individuals affected by MPS II, reducing the impact of the disease on multiple organ systems and potentially increasing life expectancy.
20301524	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) is characterized by limb shortening, normal-sized head, hitchhiker thumbs, spinal deformities (scoliosis, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, cervical kyphosis), and contractures of the large joints with deformities and early-onset osteoarthritis. Other typical findings are ulnar deviation of the fingers, gap between the first and second toes, and clubfoot. On occasion, the disease can be lethal at birth, but most affected individuals survive the neonatal period and develop physical limitations with normal intelligence. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of DTD is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features and/or biallelic pathogenic variants in SLC26A2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Biochemical studies of fibroblasts and/or chondrocytes may be used in the rare instances in which molecular genetic testing fails to identify SLC26A2 pathogenic variants. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Cervical spine surgery in infancy restricted to individuals with clinical or neurophysiologic evidence of spinal cord impingement; physical therapy may prevent early joint contractures; in children, physiotherapy and casting to maintain joint positioning and mobility as much as possible; surgical correction of clubfoot when ambulation becomes impossible; undertake orthopedic surgery with caution as deformities tend to recur; postpubertal surgical correction of scoliosis is recommended unless severe spinal deformity is causing respiratory compromise or neurologic signs; total arthroplasty of hips and knees in relatively young adults to decrease pain and increase mobility; treatment of cystic ear swelling is conservative. Surveillance: Annual monitoring of spinal curvature and joint contractures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Obesity, which places an excessive load on the large, weight-bearing joints. GENETIC COUNSELING: DTD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SLC26A2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the SLC26A2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

20301581	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Most commonly, IRF6-related disorders span a spectrum from isolated cleft lip and palate and Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) at the mild end to popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS) at the more severe end. In rare instances, IRF6 pathogenic variants have also been reported in individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial cleft (18/3,811; 0.47%) and in individuals with spina bifida (2/192). Individuals with VWS show one or more of the following anomalies: Congenital, usually bilateral, paramedian lower-lip fistulae (pits) or sometimes small mounds with a sinus tract leading from a mucous gland of the lip. Cleft lip (CL). Cleft palate (CP). Note: Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL+/-P) is observed about twice as often as CP only. Submucous cleft palate (SMCP). The PPS phenotype includes the following: CL+/-P. Fistulae of the lower lip. Webbing of the skin extending from the ischial tuberosities to the heels. In males: bifid scrotum and cryptorchidism. In females: hypoplasia of the labia majora. Syndactyly of fingers and/or toes. Anomalies of the skin around the nails. A characteristic pyramidal fold of skin overlying the nail of the hallux (almost pathognomonic). In some nonclassic forms of PPS: filiform synechiae connecting the upper and lower jaws (syngnathia) or the upper and lower eyelids (ankyloblepharon). Other musculoskeletal anomalies may include spina bifida occulta, talipes equinovarus, digital reduction, bifid ribs, and short sternum. In VWS, PPS, IRF6-related neural tube defect, and IRF6-related orofacial cleft, growth and intelligence are typical. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis of an IRF6-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in IRF6 identified by molecular genetic testing. A heterozygous pathogenic variant in IRF6 is identified in approximately 72% of individuals with the VWS phenotype, approximately 97% of individuals with the PPS phenotype, and fewer than 1% of individuals with a neural tube defect or orofacial cleft. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Supportive/symptomatic treatment of VWS and PPS may include surgical treatment of lip pits and cleft lip and palate pediatric dentistry, orthodontia, speech therapy, feeding therapy, timely treatment of otitis media due to eustachian tube dysfunction to prevent secondary hearing loss, physical therapy, orthopedic care, and surgical treatment for cryptorchidism. Surgical treatment may be needed for those with oral and/or eyelid synechiae. IRF6-related neural tube defects are treated in a standard manner as per neurosurgeon. IRF6-related orofacial clefts are treated in a standard manner. Surveillance: Surveillance for those with cleft lip and/or cleft palate includes weekly assessment of nutritional intake and weight gain during the first month of life; otolaryngologic evaluation within the first six months of life and continued throughout adolescence; audiologic evaluation with infant's first visit to cleft clinic, with the frequency of subsequent evaluations based on the history of ear disease or hearing loss; speech-language pathology evaluation by age six months, twice during the first two years of life, at least annually until age six years, at least annually until after adenoid involution, and at least every two years until dental and skeletal maturity; dental evaluation within six months of the first tooth erupting and no later than age 12 months, and routine dental evaluation continued throughout life. In individuals with myelomeningocele, assessment of walking and mobility and bowel and bladder management with each visit throughout life. GENETIC COUNSELING: IRF6-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with an IRF6-related clefting disorder (e.g., VWS or PPS) inherited an IRF6 pathogenic variant from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have manifestations of the disorder. The risk to the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the proband's parents: if a parent of the proband is affected and/or has an IRF6 pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once an IRF6 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Prenatal ultrasound examination may detect a cleft lip with/without cleft palate in some fetuses later in the second trimester, but it is much less likely to detect an isolated cleft palate or lip pits.

In some nonclassic forms of PPS: filiform synechiae connecting the upper and lower jaws (syngnathia) or the upper and lower eyelids (ankyloblepharon). Other musculoskeletal anomalies may include spina bifida occulta, talipes equinovarus, digital reduction, bifid ribs, and short sternum. In VWS, PPS, IRF6-related neural tube defect, and IRF6-related orofacial cleft, growth and intelligence are typical. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis of an IRF6-related disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in IRF6 identified by molecular genetic testing. A heterozygous pathogenic variant in IRF6 is identified in approximately 72% of individuals with the VWS phenotype, approximately 97% of individuals with the PPS phenotype, and fewer than 1% of individuals with a neural tube defect or orofacial cleft. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Supportive/symptomatic treatment of VWS and PPS may include surgical treatment of lip pits and cleft lip and palate pediatric dentistry, orthodontia, speech therapy, feeding therapy, timely treatment of otitis media due to eustachian tube dysfunction to prevent secondary hearing loss, physical therapy, orthopedic care, and surgical treatment for cryptorchidism. Surgical treatment may be needed for those with oral and/or eyelid synechiae. IRF6-related neural tube defects are treated in a standard manner as per neurosurgeon. IRF6-related orofacial clefts are treated in a standard manner. Surveillance: Surveillance for those with cleft lip and/or cleft palate includes weekly assessment of nutritional intake and weight gain during the first month of life; otolaryngologic evaluation within the first six months of life and continued throughout adolescence; audiologic evaluation with infant's first visit to cleft clinic, with the frequency of subsequent evaluations based on the history of ear disease or hearing loss; speech-language pathology evaluation by age six months, twice during the first two years of life, at least annually until age six years, at least annually until after adenoid involution, and at least every two years until dental and skeletal maturity; dental evaluation within six months of the first tooth erupting and no later than age 12 months, and routine dental evaluation continued throughout life. In individuals with myelomeningocele, assessment of walking and mobility and bowel and bladder management with each visit throughout life. GENETIC COUNSELING: IRF6-related disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with an IRF6-related clefting disorder (e.g., VWS or PPS) inherited an IRF6 pathogenic variant from a heterozygous parent who may or may not have manifestations of the disorder. The risk to the sibs of the proband depends on the genetic status of the proband's parents: if a parent of the proband is affected and/or has an IRF6 pathogenic variant, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once an IRF6 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. Prenatal ultrasound examination may detect a cleft lip with/without cleft palate in some fetuses later in the second trimester, but it is much less likely to detect an isolated cleft palate or lip pits.	Hypothetical	What would happen if a heterozygous pathogenic variant in IRF6 is identified in an individual with a neural tube defect or orofacial cleft?	The individual would be diagnosed with an IRF6-related disorder and would likely require specialized medical and surgical management for their specific manifestations.
20301635	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: PLOD1-related kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (kEDS) is an autosomal recessive generalized connective tissue disorder characterized by hypotonia, early-onset kyphoscoliosis, and generalized joint hypermobility in association with skin fragility and ocular abnormality. Intelligence is normal. Life span may be normal, but affected individuals are at risk for rupture of medium-sized arteries. Adults with severe kyphoscoliosis are at risk for complications from restrictive lung disease, recurrent pneumonia, and cardiac failure. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of PLOD1-related kEDS is established in a proband with typical clinical findings and biallelic pathogenic (or likely pathogenic) variants in PLOD1 identified by molecular genetic testing. If only one or no pathogenic variant is identified, testing for a markedly increased ratio of deoxypyridinoline to pyridinoline crosslinks in urine measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (a highly sensitive, specific, and inexpensive test) may be necessary for confirmation of the diagnosis. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Management of kyphoscoliosis by an orthopedic surgeon, including surgery as needed; physical therapy to strengthen large muscle groups; bracing to support unstable joints; protective pads and helmets during active sports; control of blood pressure to reduce the risk for arterial rupture; treatment with beta-blockers as needed to prevent aortic dilatation. Prevention of secondary complications: Standard American Heart Association guidelines for antimicrobial prophylaxis for mitral valve prolapse. Surveillance: Regular follow up by an orthopedic surgeon for management of kyphoscoliosis; routine examination for inguinal hernia; routine ophthalmologic examination for management of myopia and early detection of glaucoma or retinal detachment; echocardiogram at five-year intervals even if the initial echocardiogram is normal. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sports that stress the joints, such as gymnastics or long-distance running; high-impact sports for eye injury concerns. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women may be at increased risk for miscarriage, premature rupture of membranes, and rupture of arteries. GENETIC COUNSELING: PLOD1-related kEDS is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of a proband with EDS, kyphoscoliotic form has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the PLOD1 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.

20301654	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Three M syndrome is characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth deficiency (final height 5-6 SD below the mean; i.e., 120-130 cm), characteristic facies, and normal intelligence. Additional features of three M syndrome include short broad neck, prominent trapezii, deformed sternum, short thorax, square shoulders, winged scapulae, hyperlordosis, short fifth fingers, prominent heels, and loose joints. Males with three M syndrome have hypogonadism and occasionally hypospadias. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of three M syndrome is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CCDC8, CUL7, or OBSL1 can establish the diagnosis if clinical and radiographic features are inconclusive. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Surgical bone lengthening may be an option. Adaptive aids for people with short stature are appropriate. Significant joint laxity should prompt orthopedic evaluation and measures to control the development of arthritis. Males with three M syndrome should be referred for endocrinologic evaluation regarding gonadal function at puberty. Surveillance: Monitoring of growth every 6-12 months on standard growth charts, with special attention to growth velocity.

20301686	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) spectrum disorder is a skeletal dysplasia that represents a clinical continuum ranging from classic CCD (triad of delayed closure of the cranial sutures, hypoplastic or aplastic clavicles, and dental abnormalities), to mild CCD, to isolated dental anomalies without other skeletal features. Individuals with classic CCD spectrum disorder typically have abnormally large, wide-open fontanelles at birth that may remain open throughout life. Clavicular hypoplasia can result in narrow, sloping shoulders that can be opposed at the midline. Moderate short stature may be observed, with most affected individuals being shorter than their unaffected sibs. Dental anomalies may include delayed eruption of secondary dentition, failure to shed the primary teeth, and supernumerary teeth. Individuals with CCD spectrum disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent sinus infections, recurrent ear infections leading to conductive hearing loss, and upper airway obstruction. Intelligence is typically normal. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of CCD spectrum disorder is established in an individual with typical clinical and radiographic findings and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RUNX2 identified by molecular genetic testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: If the cranial vault defect is significant, the head needs protection from blunt trauma; helmets may be used for high-risk activities. Surgical cosmesis for depressed forehead or lengthening of hypoplastic clavicles can be considered. Careful planning of anesthetic management due to craniofacial and dental abnormalities. Consultation with an otolaryngologist to assist in securing the airway. Consideration of alternative anesthetic approaches, including neuraxial block, taking into account possible spine abnormalities. If bone density is below normal, treatment with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Dental procedures to address retention of primary dentition, presence of supernumerary teeth, and non-eruption of secondary dentition. Such procedures may include prosthetic replacements, removal of the supernumerary teeth followed by surgical repositioning of the secondary teeth, and a combination of surgical and orthodontic measures for actively erupting and aligning the impacted secondary teeth. Speech therapy as needed. Aggressive treatment of sinus and middle ear infections; consideration of tympanostomy tubes for recurrent middle ear infections; regular immunizations including influenza. Sleep study in those with manifestations of obstructive sleep apnea; surgical intervention may be required for upper airway obstruction. Surveillance: Monitor children for orthopedic complications, dental abnormalities, sinus and ear infections, upper airway obstruction, hearing loss, and speech issues. DXA scan to assess bone mineral density beginning in early adolescence and every five to ten years thereafter. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Helmets and protective devices should be worn when participating in high-risk activities. Pregnancy management: Monitor affected women during pregnancy for cephalopelvic disproportion. GENETIC COUNSELING: CCD spectrum disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of individuals with CCD spectrum disorder caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is high. Each child of an individual with CCD spectrum disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the RUNX2 pathogenic variant. Once the RUNX2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CCD spectrum disorder are possible.

Such procedures may include prosthetic replacements, removal of the supernumerary teeth followed by surgical repositioning of the secondary teeth, and a combination of surgical and orthodontic measures for actively erupting and aligning the impacted secondary teeth. Speech therapy as needed. Aggressive treatment of sinus and middle ear infections; consideration of tympanostomy tubes for recurrent middle ear infections; regular immunizations including influenza. Sleep study in those with manifestations of obstructive sleep apnea; surgical intervention may be required for upper airway obstruction. Surveillance: Monitor children for orthopedic complications, dental abnormalities, sinus and ear infections, upper airway obstruction, hearing loss, and speech issues. DXA scan to assess bone mineral density beginning in early adolescence and every five to ten years thereafter. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Helmets and protective devices should be worn when participating in high-risk activities. Pregnancy management: Monitor affected women during pregnancy for cephalopelvic disproportion. GENETIC COUNSELING: CCD spectrum disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of individuals with CCD spectrum disorder caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is high. Each child of an individual with CCD spectrum disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the RUNX2 pathogenic variant. Once the RUNX2 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CCD spectrum disorder are possible.	Causal	Why do individuals with classic CCD spectrum disorder typically have abnormally large, wide-open fontanelles at birth that may remain open throughout life?	Individuals with classic CCD spectrum disorder typically have abnormally large, wide-open fontanelles at birth that may remain open throughout life due to delayed closure of the cranial sutures, a characteristic feature of the condition.
20301711	CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: GDAP1-related hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (GDAP1-HMSN) is a peripheral neuropathy (also known as a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) that typically affects the lower extremities earlier and more severely than the upper extremities. As the neuropathy progresses, the distal upper extremities also become severely affected. Proximal muscles can also become weak. Age at onset ranges from infancy to early childhood. In most cases, disease progression causes disabilities within the first or second decade of life. At the end of the second decade, most individuals are wheelchair bound. Disease progression varies considerably even within the same family. The neuropathy can be either of the demyelinating type with reduced nerve conduction velocities or the axonal type with normal nerve conduction velocities. Vocal cord paresis is common. Intelligence is normal. Life expectancy is usually normal, but on occasion may be reduced because of secondary complications. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Diagnosis of GDAP1-HMSN is based on clinical findings and confirmed by detection on molecular genetic testing of either biallelic pathogenic variants in GDAP1 in those with autosomal recessive inheritance or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in those with autosomal dominant inheritance. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary team that includes neurologists, physiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. Treatment may include: daily heel cord stretching exercises to prevent Achilles tendon shortening, ankle/foot orthoses, orthopedic surgery, forearm crutches or canes, wheelchairs, treatment of musculoskeletal pain with acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and career and employment counseling. Surveillance: Regular evaluation by the multidisciplinary team to determine neurologic status and functional disability. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs and medications known to cause nerve damage; obesity. GENETIC COUNSELING: GDAP1-HMSN is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive (AR) manner; autosomal dominant (AD) inheritance is also observed. AR inheritance: At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives is possible once the pathogenic variants in an affected family member have been identified. AD inheritance: Offspring of an individual with AD GDAP1-HMSN have a 50% risk of inheriting the GDAP1 pathogenic variant from their affected parent. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk for GDAP1-HMSN and preimplantation genetic testing are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant(s) have been identified.

23273628	OBJECTIVES: To reduce unnecessary lab testing by predicting when a proposed future lab test is likely to contribute information gain and thereby influence clinical management in patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Recent studies have demonstrated that frequent laboratory testing does not necessarily relate to better outcomes. DESIGN: Data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification were performed and an artificial intelligence tool, fuzzy modeling, was used to identify lab tests that do not contribute an information gain. There were 11 input variables in total. Ten of these were derived from bedside monitor trends heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, temperature, blood pressure, and urine collections, as well as infusion products and transfusions. The final input variable was a previous value from one of the eight lab tests being predicted: calcium, PTT, hematocrit, fibrinogen, lactate, platelets, INR and hemoglobin. The outcome for each test was a binary framework defining whether a test result contributed information gain or not. PATIENTS: Predictive modeling was applied to recognize unnecessary lab tests in a real world ICU database extract comprising 746 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. MAIN RESULTS: Classification accuracy of necessary and unnecessary lab tests of greater than 80% was achieved for all eight lab tests. Sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory for all the outcomes. An average reduction of 50% of the lab tests was obtained. This is an improvement from previously reported similar studies with average performance 37% by [1-3]. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing frequent lab testing and the potential clinical and financial implications are an important issue in intensive care. In this work we present an artificial intelligence method to predict the benefit of proposed future laboratory tests. Using ICU data from 746 patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, and eleven measurements, we demonstrate high accuracy in predicting the likely information to be gained from proposed future lab testing for eight common GI related lab tests. Future work will explore applications of this approach to a range of underlying medical conditions and laboratory tests.

23274119	INTRODUCTION: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is one of the most frequent neurocutaneous disorders. Cortical tubers are the most common pathological changes in TSC and they are directly related to the disease's main clinical manifestations: seizures, mental retardation, and autistic behaviour. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to establish a correlation between tuber size and the severity of clinical features in TSC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of the clinical and imaging findings from 45 TSC patients (22 females and 23 males) and compared the clinical features with the location, size, and number of the cortical tubers in each patient. RESULTS: Four patients had voluminous tubers located in 1 or both cerebral hemispheres. All of these patients had intractable seizures and severe mental retardation; 3 of these cases also presented with autistic behaviour, despite tubers having been resected in all 4 patients. Thirteen patients had tubers of large-to-average size, and all patients in this group showed intractable seizures and mental retardation. Nine patients who had experienced infantile spasms during the first year of life presented autistic behaviour. Multiple tubers of small to average size were found in 28 patients. In general, this group had seizures that responded well to antiepileptic drugs and a low prevalence of autism. In 3 patients who all presented good seizure control and normal intelligence, single cortical/subcortical tubers were located in the frontal or occipital lobes. Of the total of 45 patients, 13 had cerebellar as well as cerebral tubers; these were generally present in cases with more severe clinical features. CONCLUSIONS: Although large tubers are less common than small to medium-sized ones, they are much more likely to be accompanied by severe clinical symptoms (seizures, mental retardation and autistic behaviour), even when the smaller tubers are quite numerous.	Confirmation	Do large tubers in TSC patients correlate with more severe clinical symptoms?	Yes
