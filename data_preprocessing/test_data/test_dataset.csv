37855976	N/A	N/A	3	N/A	N/A	sensitivity from 74 to 99.68%. Fourteen studies that provided sufficient data were included for meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity was 90% (95% CI 0.820.94), and the pooled specificity was 92% (CI 95% 0.87-0.96). The DORs were 103 (27-251). Publication bias was not detected based on the p-value of 0.75 in the meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: With a head and neck screening deep learning model, detectable screening processes can be enhanced with high specificity and sensitivity.
