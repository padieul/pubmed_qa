23488941,23488941,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies of thyroid cancer incidence in Wales have given varying results with suggestions of an excess of cases in geographic areas that were previously exposed to the radioactive fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor incident. Our objective in this study was to provide an up-to-date comprehensive analysis of time trends in the incidence, geographical distribution, and survival from thyroid cancer in Wales. METHODS: We identified thyroid cancer cases, registered from 1985 through 2010 in the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit (WCISU). Age standardized rates were determined from the European standard population. A Poisson regression model was fitted to assess temporal trends and rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were determined and","to assess temporal trends and rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were determined and compared across consecutive time periods: 1985-1997 and 1998-2010. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for each of the 22 local authority areas. Relative survival and Kaplan-Meier curves were computed to analyze all cause and thyroid cancer-specific survival. RESULTS: A total of 1747 thyroid cancer cases were registered from 1985 to 2010. Age standardized incidence rates were 2.8 and 1.2 per 100,000 population per year for females and males respectively. Incidence rates increased with time (RR 1.3 [CI 1.2-1.5], p < 0.001; 1998-2010 vs. 1985-1997). The incidence of papillary cancer increased progressively over the study period (RR 2.22 [CI 1.91-2.57], p < 0.001; 1998-2010 vs.",How do temporal trends in thyroid cancer diagnosis relate to the study's findings on rate ratios (RRs)?,The study aims to assess temporal trends in thyroid cancer diagnosis and their relation to RRs.
23517654,23517654,"In animal studies, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important regulator of central nervous system development and synaptic plasticity. WAGR (Wilms tumour, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and mental Retardation) syndrome is caused by 11p13 deletions of variable size near the BDNF locus and can serve as a model for studying human BDNF haploinsufficiency (+/-). We hypothesized that BDNF+/- would be associated with more severe cognitive impairment in subjects with WAGR syndrome. Twenty-eight subjects with WAGR syndrome (6-28 years), 12 subjects with isolated aniridia due to PAX6 mutations/microdeletions (7-54 years), and 20 healthy controls (4-32 years) received neurocognitive assessments. Deletion boundaries for the subjects in the WAGR group were determined by","assessments. Deletion boundaries for the subjects in the WAGR group were determined by high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization. Within the WAGR group, BDNF+/- subjects (n = 15), compared with BDNF intact (+/+) subjects (n = 13), had lower adaptive behaviour (p = .02), reduced cognitive functioning (p = .04), higher levels of reported historical (p = .02) and current (p = .02) social impairment, and higher percentage meeting cut-off score for autism (p = .047) on Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. These differences remained nominally significant after adjusting for visual acuity. Using diagnostic measures and clinical judgement, 3 subjects (2 BDNF+/- and 1 BDNF+/+) in the WAGR group (10.7%) were classified with autism spectrum disorder.

23932608,23932608,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to describe the physical growth and developmental outcomes of babies born with gastroschisis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of gastroschisis in Western Australia born between 1997 and 2010. RESULTS: In the 128 pregnancies with fetal gastroschisis, 117 babies were live born. 112 (95.7%) survived to one year. 19% had z scores of<-1.28 for weight at birth (<10th centiles) compared with 30% at one year. Neurodevelopmental data were available in 88/112 (79%) of survivors (Griffiths scores in 67; reports of ages and stages questionnaire (ASQ) in 21). The mean GQ at 12 months was 99 (SD 9.8). Suboptimal neurodevelopmental outcomes were noted in eight. Complex gastroschisis (present at birth) and acquired gut related complications were","in eight. Complex gastroschisis (present at birth) and acquired gut related complications were associated with adverse long term outcomes. The incidence of acquired gut complications was least (5%) in those who underwent silo reduction as the primary management. However, on univariate and multivariate analysis, the type of primary reduction did not significantly influence the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of infants with gastroschisis exhibit suboptimal weight gain during the first year. The incidence of adverse developmental outcomes appears to be low.","What is the main research objective or finding of the study, and how does it relate to the specific details provided?",The study's objective or main finding relates to the detailed exploration of the topic mentioned in the abstracts.

24179795,24179795,"Disruption of functional connectivity may be a key feature of bipolar disorder (BD) which reflects disturbances of synchronization and oscillations within brain networks. We investigated whether the resting electroencephalogram (EEG) in patients with BD showed altered synchronization or network properties. Resting-state EEG was recorded in 57 BD type-I patients and 87 healthy control subjects. Functional connectivity between pairs of EEG channels was measured using synchronization likelihood (SL) for 5 frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Graph-theoretic analysis was applied to SL over the electrode array to assess network properties. BD patients showed a decrease of mean synchronization in the alpha band, and the decreases were greatest in fronto-central and","of mean synchronization in the alpha band, and the decreases were greatest in fronto-central and centro-parietal connections. In addition, the clustering coefficient and global efficiency were decreased in BD patients, whereas the characteristic path length increased. We also found that the normalized characteristic path length and small-worldness were significantly correlated with depression scores in BD patients. These results suggest that BD patients show impaired neural synchronization at rest and a disruption of resting-state functional connectivity.","What is the main research objective or finding of the study, and how does it relate to the specific details provided?",The study's objective or main finding relates to the detailed exploration of the topic mentioned in the abstracts.
