23315684,23856422,"BACKGROUND: The health expectancy of Irish Travellers, a disadvantaged indigenous minority group in Ireland has not been previously estimated. This study aimed to examine health expectancy inequalities between Irish Travellers and the general population. METHODS: We used Sullivan's life table method to construct healthy life expectancy (HLE) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). The All-Ireland Traveller Health Study provided Irish Traveller population's mortality and health data. Vital registration, census and comparable national survey health data were used for the general population. We calculated the absolute and relative life expectancy, HLE and DFLE gaps between Irish Travellers and the general population and decomposed the HLE and DFLE gaps into mortality and morbidity","To carry out their duties more effectively, health care professionals in the UAE often ask about the population structure and the main causes of mortality and morbidity in the country. This paper summarizes what is known about these topics drawing on secondary data sources that are available in the public domain, including census data, population estimates, births and deaths, proportionate mortality, age-standardized mortality rates and disability adjusted life-years. There are inconsistencies and flaws in some of this data which this paper will highlight and attempt to explain. Since 2005, the UAE population has grown substantially owing to high natural growth and high net inward migration and is currently estimated to be about 8.2million. In 2008, injuries, heart disease, neoplasms and","Considering the disparities in health expectancy between Irish Travellers and the general population, and the information on population structure and causes of mortality in the UAE, how might understanding these factors contribute to formulating more targeted and effective healthcare policies, especially in addressing the unique challenges faced by disadvantaged minority groups?","By comprehending health expectancy gaps and population structures, policymakers can develop healthcare strategies that address specific challenges faced by minority groups like Irish Travellers and, simultaneously, understanding mortality causes in the UAE aids in tailoring healthcare policies to the prevalent health concerns of the population, ensuring more effective and targeted interventions.","The study found that Irish Travellers had consistently lower HLE and DFLE than the general population. The gap in HLE was wider than the gap in DFLE, and the gap in HLE was more pronounced among women than men. The study also found that mortality contributed more to the HLE gap than morbidity. The study suggests that understanding the factors contributing to the HLE gap between Irish Travellers and the general population could help formulating more targeted and effective healthcare policies.",
23443820,23767697,"The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) has been used extensively to study impairment across a range of cognitive domains in schizophrenia. However, cognitive performance among those with the illness has yet to be examined using the newest edition of this measure. Hence, the current study aims first, to provide WAIS-IV normative data for Canadian individuals with schizophrenia of low average intelligence; second, to examine schizophrenia performance on all WAIS-IV subtest, index and general intelligence scores relative to healthy comparison subjects; and third, to revalidate the pattern of impairment identified in this clinical group using the WAIS-III, where processing speed (PS) was most affected, followed by working memory (WM), perceptual reasoning (PR) and verbal comprehension","A previous study found that the Flynn effect accounts for 85% of the normative difference between 20- and 70-year-olds on subtests of the Wechsler intelligence tests. Adjusting scores for the Flynn effect substantially reduces normative age-group differences, but the appropriate amount of adjustment is uncertain. The present study replicates previous findings and employs two other methods of adjusting for the Flynn effect. Averaged across models, results indicate that the Flynn effect accounts for 76% of normative age-group differences on Wechsler IQ subtests. Flynn-effect adjustment reduces the normative age-related decline in IQ from 4.3 to 1.1 IQ points per decade.","Considering the utilization of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) in examining cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and the impact of the Flynn effect on normative age-related differences in IQ scores, how might the provision of WAIS-IV normative data for individuals with schizophrenia contribute to understanding cognitive performance in this clinical group, and what implications does adjusting for the Flynn effect have on interpreting IQ scores across different age groups?","Providing WAIS-IV normative data for individuals with schizophrenia allows for a comprehensive examination of cognitive performance in this population, shedding light on specific areas of impairment relative to healthy subjects. Additionally, adjusting for the Flynn effect reveals that a significant portion of normative age-related differences in IQ scores can be attributed to this phenomenon, suggesting the need for careful consideration when interpreting IQ scores across different age groups.","The provision of WAIS-IV normative data for individuals with schizophrenia can contribute to understanding cognitive performance in this clinical group. However, adjusting for the Flynn effect may be necessary to interpret IQ scores across different age groups.",

Our objective in this study was to provide an up-to-date comprehensive analysis of time trends in the incidence, geographical distribution, and survival from thyroid cancer in Wales.Methods: We identified thyroid cancer cases, registered from 1985 through 2010 in the Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit (WCISU). Age standardized rates were determined from the European standard population. A Poisson regression model was fitted to assess temporal trends and rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were determined and compared across consecutive time periods: 1985–1997 and 1998–2010. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for each of the 22 local authority areas. Relative survival and Kaplan–Meier curves were computed to analyze all cause and thyroid cancer–specific survival.Results: A total of 1747 thyroid cancer cases were registered from 1985 to 2010. Age standardized incidence rates were 2.8 and 1.2 per 100,000 population per year for females and males respectively. Incidence rates increased with time (RR 1.3 [CI 1.2–1.5], p<0.001; 1998–2010 vs. 1985–1997). The incidence of papillary cancer increased progressively over the study period (RR 2.22 [CI 1.91–2.57], p<0.001; 1998–2010 vs. 1985–1997), while rates for other (nonpapillary) histological subtypes remained static (RR 0.95 [CI 0.84–1.08], p=0.45; 1998–2010 vs. 1985–1997). We identified two geographical areas of increased incidence, but the spatial distribution of cases was inconsistent with exposure to radioactive fallout. Five-year relative survival from all-cause mortality improved from 74.2 [CI 66.8–80.1] in 1985–1989 to 82.6 [CI 77.1–86.9] in 2000–2004, but remained poor for patients over the age of 65 years (p<0.001, >65 years vs. 15–64 years) and patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer (p<0.001; anaplastic vs. other histological varieties).Conclusions: The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased in Wales, predominantly due to an increase in papillary cancers.

However, the volume of specimens is generally low and maintaining proficiency in reading blood smears, particularly at the species level, is challenging in this setting. To address this problem, the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab) in Alberta, Canada, implemented real-time PCR for routine confirmation of all smear-positive samples in the province. Here we report our experience over a 4-year period (2008 to 2012) with this new diagnostic algorithm. While detection of Plasmodium falciparum by microscopy alone was accurate, real-time PCR served as an important adjunct to microscopy for the identification of non-falciparum species. In 18% of cases, the result was reported as","Given the findings on thyroid cancer incidence trends in Wales and the implementation of real-time PCR for malaria diagnosis in Alberta, Canada, how might advancements in diagnostic methods impact the detection and management of diseases such as thyroid cancer and malaria, and what implications do these findings have for public health strategies?","Advancements in diagnostic methods, such as the implementation of real-time PCR for malaria diagnosis and comprehensive analysis of thyroid cancer incidence trends, enhance disease detection accuracy and contribute to better disease management. These findings underscore the importance of ongoing surveillance and the need for targeted public health strategies to address emerging trends and challenges in disease diagnosis and management.," Advancements in diagnostic methods can significantly impact the detection and management of diseases such as thyroid cancer and malaria. Real-time PCR has been implemented in clinical laboratories to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and management of these diseases. The introduction of eDNA technologies can provide a range of benefits, including early detection and management of diseases. These technologies can be used to improve public health strategies.",

A cross sectional study was conducted across two mental health and addiction treatment centers. 176 individuals were interviewed using a demographics form, SCID-DSM-IV(First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &Williams, 2002), Child Trauma Questionnaire (Bernstein & Fink, 1998), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (Petrides, 2009), The Coping, Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) (Endler & Parker, 1990), Recent Life Events Questionnaire (Department of Health, 1985) and perceived social support from family, friends and religion. Multiple, regressions and correlations were used to analyze the data. All early experiences, except physical, abuse and death of a parent in childhood, were significantly correlated with increased number of, stressors and lower wellbeing scores. This is possibly because of sample specific issues. Number of stressors partially mediated the relationship between ACEs and wellbeing. Increased number of ACEs was related to higher neuroticism and emotion-focused coping and lower conscientiousness, agreeableness, trait emotional intelligence and task coping scores. These resources were significantly related to increased stressors and lower wellbeing. Distraction and emotion coping significantly moderated the relationship between number of stressors and wellbeing. These findings support the diathesis stress model and indicate that there are significant relationships between ACEs, psychosocial, resources, stressors and wellbeing. Recommendations to improve wellbeing are discussed.","Considering the findings related to thyroid cancer incidence trends in Wales and the exploration of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), stressors, and psychosocial resources in mental health and addiction treatment centers, how might understanding the interplay between environmental factors, such as radiation exposure and adverse childhood experiences, contribute to informing public health interventions aimed at improving overall wellbeing and reducing disease burden?","Examining the relationship between thyroid cancer incidence trends in Wales and adverse childhood experiences sheds light on the complex interplay between environmental factors and health outcomes.

Patients and methods: Survivors of childhood ALL treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who were still alive at 10 or more years after diagnosis and were age ? 18 years were recruited for neurocognitive testing. In all, 1,014 survivors were eligible, 738 (72.8%) agreed to participate, and 567 (76.8%) of these were evaluated. Mean age was 33 years; mean time since diagnosis was 26 years. Medical record abstraction was performed for data on doses of cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and cumulative chemotherapy. Multivariable modeling was conducted and glmulti package was used to select the best model with minimum Akaike information criterion. Results: Impairment rates across neurocognitive domains ranged from 28.6% to 58.9%, and those treated with chemotherapy only demonstrated increased impairment in all domains (all P values < .006). In survivors who received no CRT, dexamethasone was associated with impaired attention (relative risk [RR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.11 to 4.03) and executive function (RR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.20 to 4.91). The impact of CRT was dependent on young age at diagnosis for intelligence, academic, and memory functions. Risk for executive function problems increased with survival time in a CRT dose-dependent fashion. In all survivors, self-reported behavior problems increased by 5% (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.09) with each year from diagnosis. Impairment was associated with reduced educational attainment and unemployment. Conclusion: This study demonstrates persistent and significant neurocognitive impairment in adult survivors of childhood ALL and warrants ongoing monitoring of brain health to facilitate successful adult development and to detect early onset of decline as survivors mature.","Given the findings on the incidence and survival trends of thyroid cancer in Wales and the rates, patterns, and predictors of neurocognitive impairment in adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), how might understanding these distinct health outcomes contribute to informing public health policies aimed at cancer prevention and survivorship care, and what implications do these findings have for long-term monitoring and support for cancer survivors?","By comprehensively analyzing thyroid cancer trends and neurocognitive impairment in cancer survivors, policymakers can develop targeted prevention strategies and survivorship care programs.

23517654,23796861,"In animal studies, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an important regulator of central nervous system development and synaptic plasticity. WAGR (Wilms tumour, Aniridia, Genitourinary anomalies, and mental Retardation) syndrome is caused by 11p13 deletions of variable size near the BDNF locus and can serve as a model for studying human BDNF haploinsufficiency (+/-). We hypothesized that BDNF+/- would be associated with more severe cognitive impairment in subjects with WAGR syndrome. Twenty-eight subjects with WAGR syndrome (6-28 years), 12 subjects with isolated aniridia due to PAX6 mutations/microdeletions (7-54 years), and 20 healthy controls (4-32 years) received neurocognitive assessments. Deletion boundaries for the subjects in the WAGR group were determined by high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization. Within the WAGR group, BDNF+/- subjects (n = 15), compared with BDNF intact (+/+) subjects (n = 13), had lower adaptive behaviour (p = .02), reduced cognitive functioning (p = .04), higher levels of reported historical (p = .02) and current (p = .02) social impairment, and higher percentage meeting cut-off score for autism (p = .047) on Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. These differences remained nominally significant after adjusting for visual acuity. Using diagnostic measures and clinical judgement, 3 subjects (2 BDNF+/- and 1 BDNF+/+) in the WAGR group (10.7%) were classified with autism spectrum disorder. A comparison group of visually impaired subjects with isolated aniridia had cognitive functioning comparable to that of healthy controls. In summary, among subjects with WAGR syndrome, BDNF+/- subjects had a mean Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Compose score that was 14-points lower and a mean intelligence quotient (IQ) that was 20-points lower than BDNF+/+ subjects. Our findings support the hypothesis that BDNF plays an important role in human neurocognitive development.","Purpose: To characterize epileptic spasms (ES) occurring after the age of two years in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), particularly treatment response to vigabatrin (VGB), which is extremely effective for infantile spasms (IS) in TSC. Methods: The authors retrospectively reviewed 19 patients with TSC and ES. Medical records were assessed for clinical and treatment data, neurocognitive, EEG, MRI data, and genetic analyses. Results: Of 391 patients with TSC, 19 (4.8%) had ES. Of those with detailed clinical data, six had infantile spasms that persisted after 2 years old, six recurred after an initial remission of infantile spasms (range 2-24 years old), and four occurred de novo over the age of two (range 2-20 years old). All concurrently had other seizure types. One had hypsarrhythmia on EEG. All had brain MRI stigmata typical of TSC. Thirteen had a mutation in TSC2, and one in TSC1. Six patients became spasm-free with medication treatment, including four with VGB, one with VGB in combination with the low glycemic index dietary treatment, and one with felbamate. Five became spasm-free after epilepsy surgery. VGB was not effective for seven patients. The majority continued to have refractory epilepsy. Conclusions: ES are not uncommon in patients with TSC, especially those with TSC2 mutations. ES in TSC occur in the setting of other seizure types and refractory epilepsy. Hypsarrhythmia is rare. VGB can be effective, but the success of VGB for ES in TSC is not equivalent to that of IS in TSC.

Meanwhile, the characterization of ES in patients with TSC demonstrates varied treatment responses to VGB, suggesting the need for tailored approaches in managing neurological disorders like TSC. Together, these findings advance our understanding of neurocognitive development and inform treatment strategies for neurological disorders such as WAGR syndrome and TSC.","The findings suggest that VNS may be a potential treatment option for drug-resistant epilepsy in patients with TSC. The long-term efficacy of VNS in these patients is still unclear, and further studies are needed to determine its effectiveness. The impact of VNS on cognition and emotion after a one-year follow-up was also evaluated. The findings indicate that VNS may have a positive impact on cognitive and emotional outcomes in patients with TSC-induced DRE."

However, the volume of specimens is generally low and maintaining proficiency in reading blood smears, particularly at the species level, is challenging in this setting. To address this problem, the Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab) in Alberta, Canada, implemented real-time PCR for routine confirmation of all smear-positive samples in the province. Here we report our experience over a 4-year period (2008 to 2012) with this new diagnostic algorithm. While detection of Plasmodium falciparum by microscopy alone was accurate, real-time PCR served as an important adjunct to microscopy for the identification of non-falciparum species. In 18% of cases, the result was reported as non-falciparum or the species could not be identified by microscopy alone, and in all cases, the species was resolved by real-time PCR. In another 4% of cases, the species was misidentified by microscopy. To enhance surveillance for malaria, we integrated our demographic, clinical, and laboratory data into a new system developed by the Canadian Network for Public Health Intelligence, called the Malaria System for Online Surveillance (SOS). Using this application, we characterized our patient populations and travel history to identify risk factors associated with malaria infection abroad.","To carry out their duties more effectively, health care professionals in the UAE often ask about the population structure and the main causes of mortality and morbidity in the country. This paper summarizes what is known about these topics drawing on secondary data sources that are available in the public domain, including census data, population estimates, births and deaths, proportionate mortality, age-standardized mortality rates and disability adjusted life-years. There are inconsistencies and flaws in some of this data which this paper will highlight and attempt to explain. Since 2005, the UAE population has grown substantially owing to high natural growth and high net inward migration and is currently estimated to be about 8.2million. In 2008, injuries, heart disease, neoplasms and cerebrovascular disease accounted for 57% of deaths, and this is well known. Less is reported about the risk of death, disease, injury and disability. The population of the UAE is diverse, and there are variations in mortality and morbidity risk by age-group, sex and nationality. The authors recommend improvements in the timeliness, completeness and consistency of data. They conclude that better data will encourage more analysis which will generate health intelligence leading to health improvement for the UAE population.","Considering the challenges in malaria diagnosis in clinical laboratories and the importance of accurate surveillance data for public health, how does the implementation of real-time PCR as an adjunct to microscopy in Alberta, Canada, impact the identification of malaria species, and how does the development of the Malaria System for Online Surveillance (SOS) contribute to understanding the epidemiology and risk factors associated with malaria infection abroad?","The integration of real-time PCR alongside microscopy significantly enhances the identification of malaria species, particularly non-falciparum strains, addressing the limitations of microscopy alone. Additionally, the implementation of the Malaria System for Online Surveillance (SOS) facilitates comprehensive surveillance by integrating demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, allowing for the characterization of patient populations and identification of risk factors associated with malaria infection abroad, ultimately contributing to improved public health interventions.","The implementation of real-time PCR as an adjunct to microscopy in Alberta, Canada, has improved the accuracy of malaria diagnosis, particularly for non-falciparum species. The Malaria System for Online Surveillance (SOS) has been developed to enhance surveillance for malaria, and it is now being used in many countries.",

Laboratories have reported confirmed cases by detection of viral nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid since 2004. To determine the prevalence of these diseases in Ireland during 2005-2008, we analyzed 3 data sources: Hospital In-patient Enquiry data (from hospitalized following patients discharge) accessed through Health Intelligence Ireland, laboratory confirmations from the National Virus Reference Laboratory, and events from the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting surveillance system. We found that the national surveillance system underestimates the incidence of these diseases in Ireland with a 10-fold higher VE hospitalization rate and 3-fold higher VM hospitalization rate than the reporting rate. Herpesviruses were responsible for most specified VE and enteroviruses for most specified VM from all 3 sources. Recommendations from this study have been implemented to improve the surveillance of these diseases in Ireland.","Considering the challenges in malaria diagnosis by microscopy and the implementation of real-time PCR as an adjunct, as well as the surveillance of viral encephalitis and viral meningitis in Ireland, how might the integration of advanced diagnostic techniques like real-time PCR enhance malaria surveillance, and what insights can be gained from analyzing multiple data sources to improve the surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases such as viral encephalitis and viral meningitis?","The integration of real-time PCR as an adjunct to microscopy enhances malaria surveillance by accurately identifying non-falciparum species and resolving cases where microscopy alone fails to identify the species. Additionally, analyzing multiple data sources, including hospital in-patient data, laboratory confirmations, and infectious disease reporting systems, can provide more accurate insights into the prevalence and incidence of notifiable infectious diseases like viral encephalitis and viral meningitis, ultimately leading to improvements in disease surveillance and control measures."," The integration of advanced diagnostic techniques like real-time PCR can enhance malaria surveillance, and analyzing multiple data sources can improve the surveillance of notifiable infectious diseases such as viral encephalitis and viral meningitis.",
