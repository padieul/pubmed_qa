23315684,23856422,"BACKGROUND: The health expectancy of Irish Travellers, a disadvantaged indigenous minority group in Ireland has not been previously estimated. This study aimed to examine health expectancy inequalities between Irish Travellers and the general population. METHODS: We used Sullivan's life table method to construct healthy life expectancy (HLE) and disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). The All-Ireland Traveller Health Study provided Irish Traveller population's mortality and health data. Vital registration, census and comparable national survey health data were used for the general population. We calculated the absolute and relative life expectancy, HLE and DFLE gaps between Irish Travellers and the general population and decomposed the HLE and DFLE gaps into mortality and morbidity","To carry out their duties more effectively, health care professionals in the UAE often ask about the population structure and the main causes of mortality and morbidity in the country. This paper summarizes what is known about these topics drawing on secondary data sources that are available in the public domain, including census data, population estimates, births and deaths, proportionate mortality, age-standardized mortality rates and disability adjusted life-years. There are inconsistencies and flaws in some of this data which this paper will highlight and attempt to explain. Since 2005, the UAE population has grown substantially owing to high natural growth and high net inward migration and is currently estimated to be about 8.2million.

23443820,23767697,"The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) has been used extensively to study impairment across a range of cognitive domains in schizophrenia. However, cognitive performance among those with the illness has yet to be examined using the newest edition of this measure. Hence, the current study aims first, to provide WAIS-IV normative data for Canadian individuals with schizophrenia of low average intelligence; second, to examine schizophrenia performance on all WAIS-IV subtest, index and general intelligence scores relative to healthy comparison subjects; and third, to revalidate the pattern of impairment identified in this clinical group using the WAIS-III, where processing speed (PS) was most affected, followed by working memory (WM), perceptual reasoning (PR) and verbal comprehension","A previous study found that the Flynn effect accounts for 85% of the normative difference between 20- and 70-year-olds on subtests of the Wechsler intelligence tests. Adjusting scores for the Flynn effect substantially reduces normative age-group differences, but the appropriate amount of adjustment is uncertain. The present study replicates previous findings and employs two other methods of adjusting for the Flynn effect. Averaged across models, results indicate that the Flynn effect accounts for 76% of normative age-group differences on Wechsler IQ subtests. Flynn-effect adjustment reduces the normative age-related decline in IQ from 4.3 to 1.1 IQ points per decade.",How does the Flynn effect relate to changes observed in scores on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale over time?,"The Flynn effect suggests an increase in IQ scores over time, which could explain changes observed in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale scores, indicating generational shifts in cognitive abilities."

We found that individuals with high IQ show high environmental influence on IQ into adolescence (resembling younger children), whereas individuals with low IQ show high heritability of IQ in adolescence (resembling adults), a pattern consistent with an extended sensitive period for intellectual development in more-intelligent individuals.

Despite the well documented individual differences in reading ability, its neuroanatomical correlates have not been well understood, largely due to the fact that reading is a complex skill that consists of multiple components. Using a large sample of 416 college students and 7 reading tasks, the present study successfully identified three uncorrelated components of reading ability: phonological decoding, form-sound association, and naming speed.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of gastroschisis in Western Australia born between 1997 and 2010. RESULTS: In the 128 pregnancies with fetal gastroschisis, 117 babies were live born. 112 (95.7%) survived to one year. 19% had z scores of<-1.28 for weight at birth (<10th centiles) compared with 30% at one year. Neurodevelopmental data were available in 88/112 (79%) of survivors (Griffiths scores in 67; reports of ages and stages questionnaire (ASQ) in 21). The mean GQ at 12 months was 99 (SD 9.8). Suboptimal neurodevelopmental outcomes were noted in eight. Complex gastroschisis (present at birth) and acquired gut related complications were",How do the concepts presented in the first chunk relate to the challenges or solutions mentioned in the second chunk?,"The specifics of the relationship between the concepts and challenges/solutions would need to be derived from a detailed analysis of the text, focusing on the key themes and how they interconnect."

Laboratories have reported confirmed cases by detection of viral nucleic acid in cerebrospinal fluid since 2004. To determine the prevalence of these diseases in Ireland during 2005-2008, we analyzed 3 data sources: Hospital In-patient Enquiry data (from hospitalized following patients discharge) accessed through Health Intelligence Ireland, laboratory confirmations from the National Virus Reference Laboratory, and events from the Computerised Infectious Disease Reporting surveillance system. We found that the national surveillance system underestimates the incidence of these diseases in Ireland with a 10-fold higher VE hospitalization rate","The study examined a diathesis stress model of the relationship between adverse child experiences (ACEs), stressors and psychosocial resources to explore their relationship with wellbeing. A cross sectional study was conducted across two mental health and addiction treatment centers. 176 individuals were interviewed using a demographics form, SCID-DSM-IV(First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &Williams, 2002), Child Trauma Questionnaire (Bernstein & Fink, 1998), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (Petrides, 2009), The Coping, Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) (Endler & Parker, 1990), Recent Life Events Questionnaire (Department of Health, 1985) and perceived social support from family, friends and religion. Multiple, regressions and",How do the concepts presented in the first chunk relate to the challenges or solutions mentioned in the second chunk?,"The specifics of the relationship between the concepts and challenges/solutions would need to be derived from a detailed analysis of the text, focusing on the key themes and how they interconnect."

Large populations are needed to rigorously assess atypical patterns, which, even in neurological populations, are a minority. METHODS: We studied 220 patients with focal epilepsy and 118 healthy volunteers who performed an auditory description decision task. We compared a data-driven hierarchical clustering approach to the commonly used a priori laterality index (LI) threshold (LI < 0.20 as atypical) to classify language patterns within frontal and temporal regions of interest. We explored (n = 128) whether IQ varied with different language activation patterns. RESULTS: The rate of atypical language among healthy volunteers (2.5%) and patients (24.5%) agreed with previous studies;",How do the concepts presented in the first chunk relate to the challenges or solutions mentioned in the second chunk?,"The specifics of the relationship between the concepts and challenges/solutions would need to be derived from a detailed analysis of the text, focusing on the key themes and how they interconnect."
