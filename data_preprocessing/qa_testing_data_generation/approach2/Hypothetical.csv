23277023,"The cochlear outer hair cells serve a tuning function, and any dysfunction of their electromotile response can be reflected in language disorders. Otoacoustic emissions can be used to determine any dysfunction of these cells. A set of clinical records was established to register the neurological and auditory functioning in 42 children, followed by assessment with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), the Initial Language Test (ILT), the Auditory and Phonetic Discrimination Evaluation (APDE), tests for measuring Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP) and Transient Otoacoustic Emissions (TOAE). Subjects were classified into 3 groups in this study: Control (C; n = 20), Syntactic Phonological Disorder (SPD; n = 17), and those with Phonological Disability (PD; n = 5). BAEP studies showed a clear response when all children were stimulated to 20 dB. TOAE responses displayed clear and significant differences with half-octave band reproducibility for both ears, the largest effect being observed in the right ear. The results that were compared using ANOVA tests, showed that cochlear processing affects the brain language function, playing a critical role in the language phonetic process.",What would happen if the cochlear outer hair cells lost their electromotile response in a significant portion of the child population?,"If a significant portion of the child population experienced a loss of electromotile response in the cochlear outer hair cells, it could lead to widespread language disorders, as these cells are crucial for tuning and auditory processing. We might observe an increase in cases of Syntactic Phonological Disorder (SPD) and Phonological Disability (PD), with impacts on language phonetic processes and potentially on overall communication abilities. Early detection through tests like Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs) would become critical for intervention and management."," If the cochlear outer hair cells lost their electromotile response in a significant portion of the child population, they would likely experience language disorders and difficulties with spatial hearing. The use of electro-natural hearing may provide access to the whole audible frequency range, allowing for normal hearing at low frequencies and the development of spatial hearing. This neural dynamic serving fluid intelligence may be impacted by hearing loss and hearing aid use."
23356683,"Development of the Woodcock-Johnson (3rd ed.; WJ-III; Woodcock, McGrew & Mather, 2001a) was guided in part by Carroll's (1993) 3-stratum theory of cognitive abilities and based on confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), even though Carroll used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to derive his theory. Using CFA, McGrew and Woodcock (2001) found a 9-factor model across all age ranges. To determine if the 9-factor structure holds for the full WJ-III battery, we applied currently recognized best practices in EFA to 2 school-aged 42-subtest correlation matrices (ages 9-13 and 14-19 years). Six factors emerged at the 9-13 age range, while 5 factors were indicated at the 14-19 age range. The resulting 1st-order factors displayed patterns of both convergence with and divergence from the WJ-III results presented in the Technical Manual. These results also revealed a robust manifestation of general intelligence (g) that dwarfed the variance attributed to the lower order factors. It is surprising that this study represents the first time the WJ-III full battery was subjected to EFA analyses given the instrument's significant use by practitioners and that it served as the initial evidentiary basis for Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory. The lack of confirmation of CFA results with EFA methods in the current study permits questioning of the structure of the WJ-III and its relationship with CHC theory. Additional independent, structural analyses are clearly indicated for the WJ-III full test battery before we can be confident in its structure.",What would happen if the structure of the Woodcock-Johnson (WJ-III) remains unconfirmed through additional analyses?,Continued uncertainty about the WJ-III's structure and its alignment with CHC theory.,"The lack of confirmation of CFA results with EFA methods in the current study permits questioning of the structure of the WJ-III and its relationship with CHC theory. Additional independent, structural analyses are clearly indicated for the WJ-III full test battery before we can be confident in its structure."
23490758,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive deficits have been recognized as a key feature of schizophrenia, since the first description by Kraepelin. Specifically, lower intelligence is considered a core feature of the disorder and may represent a risk factor for its development. However, whether global intelligence decreases over time in schizophrenia is not known. The aims of this quantitative meta-analysis are to gather, integrate and estimate the overall mean effect size of IQ change over time in schizophrenia as compared to healthy individuals. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify relevant studies. Longitudinal studies with at least two intelligence assessments in schizophrenia cohorts were retrieved. Studies had to report sufficient data on IQ-change and include data from healthy comparisons for computation of effect sizes. For each study, the Cohen d was calculated as well as a combined mean effect size. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were identified. Eight studies with a total of 280 patients and 306 healthy controls were suitable to be included. The mean weighted baseline IQ was 97.20 for patients and 109.26 for controls. The mean weighted IQ-change per year was +0.33 for patients and +2.08 for controls. The combined effect size was Cohen's d = -0.48, p = 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: A global cognitive deficit is present in patients with schizophrenia expressed as a lower test score increase over repeated testing as compared to healthy subjects possibly due to the lack of practice effects in patients. Thus, schizophrenia is characterized by a relative lack of gain in global cognitive abilities over time.",What would happen if a new therapy were developed that effectively halted the cognitive decline in patients with schizophrenia?,"If such a therapy were developed, patients with schizophrenia might experience a stabilization of their cognitive abilities, potentially leading to an improvement in their quality of life and daily functioning. Over time, this could result in a narrowing of the cognitive gap between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Additionally, it could challenge the current understanding that schizophrenia is characterized by a relative lack of gain in global cognitive abilities over time.","Cognitive decline in schizophrenia is a significant issue, with patients experiencing a significant loss of 16 IQ points over the course of the illness. The window for primary prevention is earlier than previously thought, with cognitive decline beginning in the third decade of illness. To evaluate the course of neuropsychological impairment, patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy controls were assessed with a comprehensive test battery."
20301331,"CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Achondroplasia is the most common cause of disproportionate short stature. Affected individuals have rhizomelic shortening of the limbs, macrocephaly, and characteristic facial features with frontal bossing and midface retrusion. In infancy, hypotonia is typical, and acquisition of developmental motor milestones is often both aberrant in pattern and delayed. Intelligence and life span are usually near normal, although craniocervical junction compression increases the risk of death in infancy. Additional complications include obstructive sleep apnea, middle ear dysfunction, kyphosis, and spinal stenosis. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Achondroplasia can be diagnosed by characteristic clinical and radiographic findings in most affected individuals. In individuals in whom there is diagnostic uncertainty or who have atypical findings, identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in FGFR3 can establish the diagnosis. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Vosoritide, a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog, was recently approved to enhance height in individuals with achondroplasia from age five years until growth plates close. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be required for increased intracranial pressure; suboccipital decompression as indicated for signs and symptoms of craniocervical junction compression; adenotonsillectomy, positive airway pressure, and, rarely, tracheostomy to correct obstructive sleep apnea; pressure-equalizing tubes for middle ear dysfunction; monitor and treat obesity; evaluation and treatment by an orthopedist if progressive bowing of the legs arises; spinal surgery may be needed for severe, persistent kyphosis; surgery to correct spinal stenosis in symptomatic adults; modification in the school and work setting to optimize function; educational support in socialization and school adjustment. Surveillance: Monitor height, weight, and head circumference in childhood using growth curves standardized for achondroplasia; evaluation of developmental milestones throughout infancy and childhood using achondroplasia-specific standards; baseline neuroimaging of craniocervical junction and brain in infancy; neurologic examinations monitoring for signs of cervical myelopathy; monitor for signs and symptoms of sleep apnea; hearing evaluation as a newborn and tympanometric and behavioral audiometric evaluation by age approximately one year; monitor for middle ear problems or evidence of hearing loss in childhood; clinical assessment for kyphosis and bowed legs, with radiographic evaluation and referral to an orthopedist if necessary; in adults, clinical history and neurologic examination to screen for spinal stenosis with development of any new signs or symptoms or at least every three to five years; discuss social adjustment at each visit with primary care provider. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Rear-facing car seats should be used as long as possible to avoid injury from motor vehicle accident. Avoid soft-back infant seats and front carriers without a firm back. Avoid activities in which there is risk of injury to the craniocervical junction, such as collision sports; use of a trampoline; diving from diving boards; vaulting in gymnastics; and hanging upside down from the knees or feet on playground equipment (due to risk of falling onto the head or neck). Pregnancy management: Pregnant women with achondroplasia must undergo cesarean section delivery because of small pelvic size. GENETIC COUNSELING: Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Around 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have parents with average stature and have achondroplasia as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. Such parents have a very low risk of having another child with achondroplasia. An individual with achondroplasia who has a reproductive partner with average stature is at 50% risk in each pregnancy of having a child with achondroplasia. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk to their offspring of having average stature is 25%; of having achondroplasia, 50%; and of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal condition), 25%. If the proband and the proband's reproductive partner are affected with different dominantly inherited skeletal dysplasias, genetic counseling becomes more complicated because of the risk of inheriting two dominant skeletal dysplasias. If the FGFR3 pathogenic variant has been identified in the affected parent or parents, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk for achondroplasia is possible.","What would happen if activities with a risk of craniocervical junction injury, such as hanging upside down, are avoided?",The risk of injury to the craniocervical junction is reduced.,The patient should be positioned in a prone position with the head elevated at 30 degrees. The Bluebag fixation system should be used to secure the patient's head and neck in this position. The adjustable armrest should be used to provide support for the patient's neck and head. The patient should be monitored for any signs of airway obstruction or respiratory distress. 
25541740,"PURPOSE: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) contains a narrative generation task in which clients tell a story from a wordless picture book; however, the resulting narrative is not usually examined for its linguistic properties. This study aimed to examine narrative generation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by comparing narratives elicited from children with ASD during the ADOS to those produced by language-matched typically-developing (TD) peers. METHOD: Participants were children with ASD (n = 11) and TD controls (n = 17). Both groups were aged 9-15 years and were matched for expressive and receptive language skills and non-verbal intelligence. Narratives were analysed for local structure elements (length, fluency, errors, semantics and syntax), cohesion and global elements (story grammar and internal state language). RESULT: Results indicated that the narratives of the children with ASD were syntactically less complex, contained more ambiguous pronouns and included fewer story grammar elements than their control counterparts; with further analysis showing differences between younger and older children. CONCLUSION: The present findings provide evidence that children with ASD exhibit subtle story generation impairments and provide preliminary support for the inclusion of narratives elicited as part of the ADOS in the assessment of specific language skills in this population",What would happen if the ADOS narrative generation task was significantly modified to focus more on the linguistic properties of the stories told by children with ASD?,"f the ADOS narrative generation task were modified in such a way, it might lead to a better understanding of specific language impairments in children with ASD. This could potentially result in the development of more targeted therapeutic interventions that address the unique linguistic challenges faced by these children, such as syntactical complexity and the use of ambiguous pronouns. Over time, we could observe an improvement in narrative skills and possibly a more nuanced assessment of language abilities in ASD populations.","Children with ASD may have difficulty generating narratives due to their language impairments, with younger children exhibiting more complex narratives and older children containing fewer story grammar elements."
25562770,"BACKGROUND: The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, introduced as part of the Affordable Care Act, directed the FDA to create an approval pathway for biologic products shown to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an FDA-approved innovator drug. These biosimilars will not be chemically identical to the reference agent. Investigational studies conducted with biosimilar agents will likely provide limited real-world evidence of their effectiveness and safety. How do we best monitor effectiveness and safety of biosimilar products once approved by the FDA and used more extensively by patients? OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of developing a distributed research network that will use health insurance plan and health delivery system data to detect biosimilar safety and effectiveness signals early and be able to answer important managed care pharmacy questions from both the government and managed care organizations. METHODS: Twenty-one members of the AMCP Task Force on Biosimilar Collective Intelligence Systems met November 12, 2013, to discuss issues involved in designing this consortium and to explore next steps. RESULTS: The task force concluded that a managed care biosimilars research consortium would be of significant value. Task force members agreed that it is best to use a distributed research network structurally similar to existing DARTNet, HMO Research Network, and Mini-Sentinel consortia. However, for some surveillance projects that it undertakes, the task force recognizes it may need supplemental data from managed care and other sources (i.e., a """"hybrid"""" structure model). CONCLUSIONS: The task force believes that AMCP is well positioned to lead the biosimilar-monitoring effort and that the next step to developing a biosimilar-innovator collective intelligence system is to convene an advisory council to address organizational governance.",What would be the next step suggested by the task force to develop a biosimilar-innovator collective intelligence system?, Convene an advisory council to address organizational governance.,The next step suggested by the task force to develop a biosimilar-innovator collective intelligence system is to convene an advisory council to address organizational governance.
25705050,"Previous research has indicated a close link between spatial and mathematical thinking. However, what shared processes account for this link? In this study, we focused on the spatial skill of map reading and the mathematical skill of proportional reasoning and investigated whether scaling, or the ability to relate information in different-sized representations, is a shared process. Scaling was experimentally manipulated in both tasks. In the map task, 4- and 5-year-olds (N=50) were asked to point to the same position shown on a map in a larger referent space on a touch screen. The sizes of the maps were varied systematically, such that some trials required scaling and some did not (i.e., the map had the same size as the referent space). In the proportional reasoning task, children were presented with different relative amounts of juice and water and were asked to estimate each mixture on a rating scale. Again, some trials required scaling, but others could be solved by directly mapping the proportional components onto the rating scale. Children's absolute errors in locating targets in the map task were closely related to their performance in the proportional reasoning task even after controlling for age and verbal intelligence. Crucially, this was only true for trials that required scaling, whereas performance on nonscaled trials was not related. These results shed light on the mechanisms involved in the close connection between spatial and mathematical thinking early in life.",What would happen if a new educational curriculum were introduced that focused extensively on scaling exercises in early childhood education?,"If an educational curriculum were implemented that emphasized scaling exercises, we might expect to see improvements in both spatial skills, like map reading, and mathematical skills, such as proportional reasoning, in young children. This could potentially enhance the overall cognitive development related to spatial and mathematical thinking, given the close connection between these areas established by the research. Such improvements could translate into better academic performance in subjects that require these cognitive skills.","The introduction of a curriculum focusing extensively on scaling exercises in early childhood education could potentially lead to improved physical fitness and overall health among students. Additionally, the cultivation of early childhood educators' physical education ability would be beneficial in the long run, as it would allow them to better teach and guide students in physical activities."
27708145,"There is considerable controversy about the existence, extent and adaptive value of integrated multimodal memory in non-human animals. Building on prior results showing that wild capuchin monkeys in Argentina appear to recall both the location and amount of food at patches they had previously visited, I tested whether they also track and use elapsed time as a basis for decisions about which feeding patches to visit. I presented them with an experimental array of eight feeding sites, at each of which food rewards increased with increasing elapsed time since the previous visit, similar to the pattern of ripe fruit accumulation in natural feeding trees. Over the course of 68 days, comprising two distinct renewal rate treatments, one group repeatedly visited sites in the feeding array, generating 212 valid choices between sites. Comparison of observations against simulated movements and multinomial statistical models shows that the monkeys' choices were most consistent with dynamic memory for elapsed time specific to each of the eight sites. Thus, it appears that capuchin monkeys possess and use integrated memories of prior food patch use, including where the patch is relative to their current location, how productive the patch is and how long it has been since they last visited the patch. Natural selection to use such integrated memories in foraging tasks may provide an ecologically relevant basis for the evolution of complex intelligence in primates.","What would happen if capuchin monkeys were introduced to a new environment where the availability of food resources did not increase over time, contrary to their previous experiences?","If capuchin monkeys were introduced to such an environment, their foraging efficiency might decrease initially due to their reliance on integrated memories of elapsed time for food availability. They would likely need to adapt their foraging strategies, potentially leading to a shift in how they prioritize and select feeding sites, which could also affect their overall feeding patterns and possibly the structure of their social groups.",Capuchin monkeys would likely face decreased survival and reproduction rates due to the lack of food resources in the new environment. Their current ability to use dynamic memory for elapsed time and their extended lifespans may not be sufficient to overcome the challenges of the new environment.
28073076,"BACKGROUND: The neuropsychological literature on preterm-born children with spastic diplegia due to periventricular leukomalacia is convergent in reporting deficits in non-verbal intelligence and in visuo-spatial abilities. Nevertheless, other cognitive functions have found to be impaired, but data are scant and not correlated with neuroimaging findings. AIMS: This study analyzes the neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses in preterm-born children with spastic diplegia (pSD) and their relationships with neuroanatomical findings, investigated by a novel scale for MRI classification. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Nineteen children with pSD, mild to moderate upper limb impairment and Verbal IQ>80, and 38 normal controls were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (NEPSY-II), assessing Attention/Executive Functioning, Language, Memory, Sensorimotor, Social Perception and Visuospatial Processing domains. The MRIs were quantitatively scored for lesion severity. OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: The results showed that, beyond core visuo-spatial and sensory-motor deficits, impairments in attention and executive functions were present in more than half of the sample, particularly in children with damage to the anterior corpus callosum. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings are discussed in terms of clinical and rehabilitative implications tailored for pSD subgroups diversified for neuropsychological and neuroanatomical characteristics.",What would happen if a new rehabilitation program was developed that focused on enhancing visuo-spatial and sensorimotor skills in preterm-born children with spastic diplegia?,"If such a program were developed and implemented, it might lead to improvements in the core deficits of visuo-spatial and sensorimotor functions in these children. Moreover, if the program included targeted exercises for attention and executive functions, particularly for those with damage to the anterior corpus callosum, we could see a broader cognitive enhancement. This could potentially result in better overall neuropsychological functioning and improved daily living activities, supporting the clinical and rehabilitative needs specific to this group.","The proposed rehabilitation program focusing on enhancing visuo-spatial and sensorimotor skills in preterm-born children with spastic diplegia (pSD) may improve executive functioning and visuo-spatial skills. The study's strengths include the use of a stepped wedge design, the inclusion of a control group, and the use of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. The study's limitations include the small sample size and the lack of a control group."
25876339,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the differences in the clinical efficacy on Alzheimer's disease between acupuncture and medicine. METHODS: One hundred and forty-one patients were randomized into an acupuncture group (72 cases) and a medicine group (69 cases). In the acupuncture group, the needling technique for benefiting qi, promoting blood circulation, regulating mind and improving intelligence was used at Shenting (GV 24), Baihui (GV 20), Fengchi (GB 20), Wangu (GB 12), Danzhong (CV 17), Zhangwan (CV 12), Qihai (CV 6), Xuehai (SP 10) and Zusanli (ST 36). The supplementary acupoints were selected according to the symptoms and physical signs. Acupuncture was given once a day and 6 treatments were required for a week. In the medicine group, the choline sterase inhibitor, donepezil (aricept) was prescribed for oral administration, 1 tablet (5 mg) each time, once every night. Four weeks later, the dose was increased to 2 tablets (10 mg) each time. In the two groups, the treatment of 4 weeks made one session and 4 sessions were required. The changes of scores before and after treatment in the minimum mental state examination (MMSE), the activity of daily living scale (ADL), Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognition (ADAS-cog) and the digit span (DS) were observed. RESULTS: After treatment, scores of MMSE and DS were increased as compared with those before treatment (both P < 0.05) and scores of ADL and ADAS-cog were reduced as compared with those before treatment. The score differences in MMSE, ADL, ADAS-cog and DS before and after treatment were significant in the two groups (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The needling technique for benefiting qi, promoting blood circulation, regulating mind and improving intelligence significantly improves the overall function, cognition and activity of daily life in the patients of Alzheimer's disease and the efficacy is better than donepezil.",What would happen if acupuncture became the standard treatment for Alzheimer's disease based on the findings that it significantly improves overall function and cognition compared to donepezil?,"If acupuncture became the standard treatment for Alzheimer's disease, we might see a substantial shift towards non-pharmaceutical treatment strategies, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and a reevaluation of current treatment protocols for cognitive disorders.","Yes, if acupuncture becomes the standard treatment for Alzheimer's disease based on the findings that it significantly improves overall function and cognition compared to donepezil, it could potentially be a more effective and safer treatment option for VD patients."
