RESULTS: The mean reading time for the radiology resident was not significantly affected by the AI tool (without AI 370s vs with AI 437s; +67s 95% CI -28s to +163s, p = 0.16). The reading time for the radiology consultant was also not significantly affected by the AI tool (without AI 366s vs with AI 380s; +13s (95% CI - -57s to 84s, p = 0.70). The AI tool led to additional actionable findings in 5/40 (12.5%) studies and better overview in 18/20 (90%) of studies for the resident.	radiologists answered questions regarding additional findings and perceived case overview. Reading times were recorded for 25 cases without and 20 cases with AI tool assistance for each reader. Differences in reading time with and without the AI tool were assessed using Welch's t-test for non-inferiority with non-inferiority limits defined as 100 seconds for the consultant and 200 seconds for the resident. RESULTS: The mean reading time for the radiology resident was not significantly affected	did not differ according to AI use (mean 18.6 s vs. 18.4 s, p = 0.452). Reading times increased as abnormality scores increased, and a more significant increase was observed with AI use (coefficient 0.09 vs. 0.06, p < 0.001). Therefore, the reading times of CXRs among radiologists were influenced by the availability of AI. Overall reading times shortened when radiologists referred to AI; however, abnormalities detected by AI could lengthen reading times.	Complex	How did the availability of AI technology impact the reading times of radiologists and their identification of abnormalities in CXRs?	The availability of AI technology influenced the overall reading times of radiologists, with a shorter reading time when referring to AI. However, abnormalities detected by AI could lengthen the reading times. The reading times increased with AI use as abnormality scores increased.	Dense	N/A	gpt-3.5-turbo-1106	N/A
