The reading time for the radiology consultant was also not significantly affected by the AI tool (without AI 366s vs with AI 380s; +13s (95% CI - -57s to 84s, p = 0.70). The AI tool led to additional actionable findings in 5/40 (12.5%) studies and better overview in 18/20 (90%) of studies for the resident.	radiologists answered questions regarding additional findings and perceived case overview. Reading times were recorded for 25 cases without and 20 cases with AI tool assistance for each reader. Differences in reading time with and without the AI tool were assessed using Welch's t-test for non-inferiority with non-inferiority limits defined as 100 seconds for the consultant and 200 seconds for the resident. RESULTS: The mean reading time for the radiology resident was not significantly affected	did not differ according to AI use (mean 18.6 s vs. 18.4 s, p = 0.452). Reading times increased as abnormality scores increased, and a more significant increase was observed with AI use (coefficient 0.09 vs. 0.06, p < 0.001). Therefore, the reading times of CXRs among radiologists were influenced by the availability of AI. Overall reading times shortened when radiologists referred to AI; however, abnormalities detected by AI could lengthen reading times.	Complex	How did the availability of AI technology impact the reading times of radiologists and their identification of abnormalities in CXRs?	The availability of AI technology influenced the overall reading times of radiologists, with a shorter reading time when referring to AI. However, abnormalities detected by AI could lengthen the reading times. The reading times increased with AI use as abnormality scores increased.	Dense	N/A	gpt-3.5-turbo-1106	N/A

Although, a few minutes exposure to the UVC can destroy or inactivate the viruses and the pathogens, few doses of UVC light may damage the proteins of edible items and can affect the fruits and vegetables.

This causes limited UVC	along with UVC to auto detect the edible items and act accordingly. This causes limited UVC doses to be applied on different items as detected by proposed model according to their permissible limit. Additionally, the device is employed with a smart architecture which leads to consistent distribution of UVC light on the complete surface of the edible items. This results in saving the health as well as nutrition of edible items.
