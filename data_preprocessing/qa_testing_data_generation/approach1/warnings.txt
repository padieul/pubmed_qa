Original Reply: '1. What are the potential benefits of using artificial intelligence decision support tools to improve medication reconciliation, and how does this approach aim to bridge the knowledge gap in healthcare teams?
   - Answer: The potential benefits of using artificial intelligence decision support tools in medication reconciliation include improving accuracy and efficiency, engaging patients in the process, and creating a collaborative approach between patients, nurses, and physicians. This approach aims to bridge the knowledge gap by allowing patients to review and annotate their medication list before making decisions together with their physician.

2. How does the incorporation of iPad-based software tools with AI decision support aim to improve medication reconciliation, and what are the key features of this approach?
   - Answer: The incorporation of iPad-based software tools with AI decision support aims to engage patients in "self-service" medication reconciliation and facilitate the sharing of annotated reconciled lists with their physician. Key features of this approach include patient engagement, collaborative decision-making, and improved workflow through the use of technology.'
