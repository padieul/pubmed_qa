When R is fixed, bisection search in combination with minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm was applied to optimize Q from the non-convex fractional programming sub-problem. During each iteration of MM, another bisection search algorithm is proposed, which is able to find the global optimal closed-form solution of Q given the initial point from the	strategy was also proposed. The variable coefficient changes with the shrinkage factor alpha. Thus, the search ability was balanced at different early and late stages by controlling the dynamic changes of the variable coefficient. In the early stages of optimization, its speed is low to avoid falling into local optimization. In the later stages of optimization, the speed is higher, and finding the optimal solution is easier, balancing the two different global and local optimization capabilities	developed and introduced in the mid-1990s, have been proposed, especially in the last two decades. In this article, a systematic literature review about those variants and improvements is made, which also covers the hybridisation and parallelisation of the algorithm and its extensions to other classes of optimisation problems, taking into consideration the most important ones.

We aimed to shorten queuing times and improve visiting satisfaction. METHODS: We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted program named Smart-doctor. A randomized controlled trial was conducted at Shanghai Children's Medical Center. Participants were randomly divided into an AI-assisted and conventional group. Smart-doctor was used as a medical assistant in the AI-assisted	AI-assisted and conventional group. Smart-doctor was used as a medical assistant in the AI-assisted group. At the end of the visit, an e-medical satisfaction questionnaire was asked to be done. The primary outcome was the queuing time, while secondary outcomes included the consulting time, test time, total time, and satisfaction score. Wilcoxon rank sum test, multiple linear regression and ordinal regression were also used. RESULTS: We enrolled 740 eligible patients (114 withdrew, response	p < 0.01), and total time (40.20 [IQR 26.40, 73.80] vs. 110.40 [IQR 68.40, 164.40] minutes, p < 0.01). The overall satisfaction score was increased by 17.53% (p < 0.01) in the AI-assisted group. In addition, multiple linear regression and ordinal regression showed that the queuing time and satisfaction were mainly affected by group (p < 0.01), and missing the turn (p < 0.01).

We will review the results based on these measures in patients with bipolar disorders. Finally, we argue for the use of innovative techniques such as signal processing and artificial intelligence techniques for routine care and precision medicine in bipolar disorders.	Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Today, there is a urgent need to find indicators of the disease. Specifically, they could be useful to improve the diagnosis and the early detection, the prognosis, to estimate the treatment response and to create homogeneous subgroups of patients based on similar pathophysiological mechanisms. Here, we assume that visual electrophysiology in combination with a neuropsychological assessment can give additional data to routine practice, especially to	with a neuropsychological assessment can give additional data to routine practice, especially to precise specific damages and pathophysiological characteristics of these patients. Visual electrophysiology is characterized by an electroretinogram and the delivery of visual evoked potentials, which measure retinal and visual cortical neuronal functioning in response to visual stimulations.

Music and language share many attributes and a large body of evidence shows that sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is positively related to language development and even subsequent reading acquisition.

What remains unclear is whether sensitivity to acoustic cues in music is associated with reading in Chinese, a morphosyllabic language.
