In these tests, items are presented in order of increasing difficulty. The presentation of items is adaptive in the sense that a session is discontinued once a test taker produces a certain number of incorrect responses in sequence, with subsequent (not observed) responses commonly scored as wrong.

The higher efficiency provided by	artificial intelligence successfully referred all 4 eyes with multiple vision-threatening diseases. Deep learning artificial intelligence graded images (35.6  +/-  13.3 s) faster than the tele-ophthalmology grader (129  +/-  41.0) and clinical ophthalmologist (68  +/-  21.9, p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Deep learning artificial intelligence can increase the efficiency and accessibility of vision-threatening disease screenings, particularly in underserved communities. Deep learning artificial	one vision-threatening disease. Deep learning artificial intelligence marked 150/385 (38.9%) eyes as ungradable, compared to 10/385 (2.6%) ungradable as per the human gold standard (p < 0.001). Deep learning artificial intelligence had 63.2% sensitivity, 94.5% specificity, 32.0% positive predictive value, and 98.4% negative predictive value in vision-threatening disease referrals. Deep learning artificial intelligence successfully referred all 4 eyes with multiple vision-threatening diseases.
