Is diagnosing normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) via non-contrast CT brain scans currently a straightforward task?	No	"Yes, diagnosing NPH via non-contrast CT brain scans is currently a difficult task due to the lack of universally agreed-upon standards for radiographic parameter measurement. A variety of radiological parameters, such as Evans' index, narrow sulci at high parietal convexity, Sylvian fissures' dilation, focally enlarged sulci, and more, are currently measured by radiologists. This study aimed to enhance NPH diagnosis by comparing the accuracy,

Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical syndrome that mainly targets the elderly population. It features dementia, impaired walking, and the malfunction of sphincters. The rapid identification and large-scale screening of patients with NPH are of great significance as surgical interventions can greatly improve or even reverse the symptoms. This review aims to summarize the traditional parameters used to diagnose NPH and the emerging progression in neuroimaging. As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs of NPH may precede clinical symptoms, we sought to evaluate an algorithm that automatically detects this pattern. A support vector machine (SVM) was trained in 30 NPH patients treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunts and 30 healthy controls. For comparison, four neuroradiologists visually assessed sagittal MPRAGE images and graded them as no NPH pattern, possible NPH pattern, or definite NPH. The SVM algorithm was evaluated in 30 NPH patients and 30 healthy controls. The accuracy of the SVM algorithm was compared with the visual assessment of the neuroradiologists. The results showed that the SVM algorithm was more accurate than the visual assessment of the neuroradiologists. The SVM algorithm was able to detect NPH with an accuracy of 0.93, while the visual assessment of the neuroradiologists was only 0.67.

The performance of the global RNN-based model varied with increasing organizational counts in phishing email detection using FL. The results corroborated the comparable performance statistics of FL in phishing email detection to centralized learning for balanced datasets and low organizational counts. Moreover, we observed a variation in performance when increasing the organizational counts. For a fixed total email dataset, the global RNN-based model had a 1.8% accuracy decrease when the organizational counts were increased from 2 to 10. In contrast, BERT was the first to investigate the use of FL in phishing email detection. This study focused on building upon a deep neural network model, particularly recurrent convolutional neural network (RNN) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), for phishing email detection. We analyzed the FL-entangled learning performance in various settings, including (i) a balanced and asymmetrical data distribution among organizations and (ii) scalability.

The present study developed a framework to capture and analyze neuronal mitochondrial networks by using a 4-step process composed of 2D and 3D observation, primary and secondary virtual reality (VR) analysis, with the help of AI-powered Aivia segmentation and arborization trees. The 4-step process resolved the complicated neuronal mitochondrial networks into discrete neuronal mitochondrial meshes. Second, we measured the two parameters of the neuronal mitochondrial meshes, and the results showed that the surface area of mitochondrial meshes was the biggest in dendritic trees and the smallest in granular-like axons. Finally, we suggested that heritable and environmentally caused differences in mitochondrial functioning affect the integrity and efficiency of neurons and supporting glia cells and may thus contribute to individual differences in higher-order cognitive functioning and physical health.

What is MitoSegNet?	MitoSegNet is a pretrained deep learning segmentation model that enables researchers to easily exploit the power of deep learning for the quantification of mitochondrial morphology.	MitoSegNet is a machine learning algorithm used to enhance the resolution of protein structures constructed from cryo-EM data. It is particularly effective in enhancing the resolution of protein structures constructed from cryo-EM data irrespective of protein type, shape, and size. On several independent datasets of various protein types, CryoSegNet outperforms two top machine learning particle pickers, crYOLO, and Topaz, as well as SAM itself. The average resolution of density maps reconstructed from the particles picked by CryoSegNet is 3.05 Å, which is 15% better than Topaz and 49% better than crYOLO. Therefore, CryoSegNet can be applied to enhance the resolution of protein structures.	Factoid-type
Why is quantification of mitochondrial microscopy images a challenging task?	Efficient quantification of mitochondrial microscopy images is a challenging task and bottleneck for statistically robust conclusions due to the complexity of mitochondrial morphology.	Mitochondrial Segmentation Network (MitoSegNet) is a deep learning segmentation model that enables researchers to easily exploit the power of deep learning for the quantification of mitochondrial morphology. MitoSegNet outperformed other methods in both pixelwise and morphological segmentation accuracy. It can be applied to unseen fluorescence microscopy images of mitoGFP expressing mitochondria in wild-type and catp-6 (ATP13A2) mutant C. elegans arborization trees and long projection axons of Purkinje cells.

Shared intentionality plays a crucial role in promoting cognition and facilitating interaction in children. The emotional bond evokes intentionality in neonates, allowing them to manifest unexpected achievements while performing them with caregivers. This outcome shows an appearance of protoconversation in adult-child dyads through shared intentionality. The article presents experimental data of other studies that extend our knowledge about human cognition by showing an increase of coordinated neuronal activities and the acquisition of new knowledge by subjects in the absence of sensory cues. This highlights the contribution of interpersonal interaction to gain cognition, discussed already by Vygotsky. The current theoretical study hypothesizes that if shared intentionality promotes cognition from the onset, this interaction modality can also facilitate cognition in older children.	Complex

What would happen if medical imaging technology relied solely on 2D architectures without using segmentations?	The accuracy of medical imaging technology may decrease especially for more difficult tasks, as head-to-head comparisons have shown that more sophisticated architectures outperform 2D architectures.	If medical imaging technology relied solely on 2D architectures without using segmentations, the accuracy of the resulting images would likely decrease due to the lack of information on the spatial location of the segmented regions. Segmentations are essential for accurate segmentation of medical images, and their absence could lead to misdiagnosis and misclassification of medical conditions. Therefore, relying solely on 2D architectures without segmentations would likely result in decreased accuracy and potential misdiagnosis.	Hypothetical
