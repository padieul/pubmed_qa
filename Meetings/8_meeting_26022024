Still left to do: 
- add filtering of retrieval by metadata (years, authors, keywords)

- update the front-end from node.js to svelte
- add additional formatting for the references in the QAs systems answer

- extend testing data set generatio with gui for manual test data cleaning 
  and quality control (make sure that all question types are present)

- add readme.md sections for the remaining things
